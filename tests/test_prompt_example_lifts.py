"""No worked example in an extraction prompt may be lifted from the corpus
the prompt is measured on.

The 2026-09-05 audit found the count-exclusion example in the then-shipped
(v10-based) ``dream._SYSTEM_PROMPT`` — "[5] saw a Northern Flicker today, that makes 32
species at the park now" -> value "32" — is a paraphrase of LongMemEval
question ``affe2881``'s own answer turn, and "32" is that question's gold.
The rule it illustrates was written to recover that exact question (it is
one of seven ``frozen-total`` losses in ``c2op-count-census.json``) and was
gated on the 78-question slice containing it. Two more lifts surfaced in the
same sweep: the collection-membership example's value "road bike" is the
gold of ``89941a94`` and ``gpt4_e414231f``, and ``events_pass_v2``'s jam
example is question ``2b8f3739``'s answer turn with one word removed.

Two predicates, because each catches what the other cannot:

* **values vs gold** — every ``"value"`` / ``"description"`` string a worked
  example emits, checked case-insensitively against every gold answer. Finds
  "32" and "road bike"; blind to the jam example, whose value ($225) is a
  summand of the gold ($495), not the gold.
* **shingles vs corpus** — every word 4-gram of every bracketed example note,
  checked against both dataset files. Finds the Flicker and jam sentences;
  blind to "road bike", a phrase the corpus writes 625 different ways.

Both are asserted as EQUALITY against a dated allowlist keyed by (carrier,
example), so recorded debt can neither grow (a new lift fails) nor rot (an
entry that stops hitting must be deleted). The debt is recorded rather than
paid here: the shipped prompt is byte-pinned to a measured artifact
(``test_op_prompt_artifact.py``), so re-cutting it is a prompt change with
its own ladder gate, and the archived ``ku_op_prompt_v*`` variants are the
committed arms of past gates and cannot be edited at all.

Carriers are the live ``dream.py`` constants plus every file under
``evals/prompts``; the Titlecase-only name scan on the shim-prompt branch
misses both lowercase values and paraphrased prose, which is why this guard
exists as well as that one.

Coverage caveat: the two dataset tests skip where ``evals/data`` is absent —
that is CI, which fetches no benchmark data — so a NEW lift is caught only
by the mandatory local full-suite run on a machine holding the LongMemEval
files. A green CI here proves the structural half only.
