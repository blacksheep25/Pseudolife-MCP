"""Task 2: CortexStore member model — set-valued slots.

A slot can hold either one scalar current record (the existing model) or
many "member" current records (this feature) — never both at once. A scalar
occupying a slot is converted one-way to a member the first time
``add_member`` targets that slot (the scalar row survives as an audit-visible
superseded record, ``superseded_by_value == "(converted to set)"``; there is
no path back from set to scalar).

Dedup at a set slot is confirm-or-insert, never contest: see
``CortexStore.add_member``'s docstring for the v1 decision this pins down.
One exception: an add against a slot whose current scalar is a number-led
aggregate value ("32", "$1,500") is protected — the guard parks the add as
a scalar contender (or confirms the scalar, if the add repeats its value)
instead of converting the slot to a set. See the aggregate-conversion-guard
cases below.

Embeddings are injected the same way ``tests/test_cortex.py`` does — a
deterministic unit vector per input, so these run without a
sentence-transformer. Unlike that file's single-seed helper, ``emb(text)``
here is keyed off the *normalised text itself*, so that near-duplicate
strings ("road bike" / "Road Bike") land on the identical vector (exercising
both the norm-equality and the cosine-dedup branches), while distinct
strings land — with overwhelming probability at 64 dimensions — on
low-cosine vectors, so the 100-distinct-tags cap test doesn't spuriously
dedup.

    Stage 1 is deliberately ONE add and nothing else. ``dirty_slots`` is

# --- Task 6: serving — one entry per set slot ------------------------------
#
# Today each member of a set-valued slot surfaces as its OWN entry in
# cortex_search (it is a plain current record, so the dense/BM25 pool ranks
# it exactly like a scalar fact). These tests pin the grouping: a set slot
# must collapse to exactly ONE entry, ranked by its best-scoring member, with
# a composed value string that names the WHOLE current membership (not just
# whichever members happened to individually clear the score floor).
#
# Embeddings are injected directly (bypassing the real embedder, and
# ``svc.set_add``'s own embedding call) so ranking is deterministic: two
# orthogonal unit vectors for the two members, and ``encode_query`` stubbed
# to hand back one of them verbatim — cosine 1.0 for the named member, 0.0
# for the other, with no dependence on how the real sentence-transformer
# happens to score "road bike" against "gravel bike".
