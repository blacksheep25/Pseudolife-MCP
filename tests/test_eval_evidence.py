"""Published benchmark numbers must be backed by committed evidence.

Two audits (2026-07-17, 2026-07-21) found the same failure twice: a number
reaches the docs while the run that produced it stays in a terminal or an
untracked working-copy file. Nothing contradicts such a claim, so no guard
test and no docs-currency pass ever surfaces it — a reader simply cannot
check it, and neither can we.

This pins the load-bearing published numbers to the artifacts they came
from. Deciding whether a number is *right* needs a GPU and stays a manual
gate; deciding whether it is *backed* is pure parsing, so it runs here.

Adding a benchmark claim to the docs means adding a row below. The
`needle` is verbatim doc text: if a rewrite drops it, the guard fails
rather than quietly stopping guarding.

# ── the agent-side token ledger (2026-09-04) ──────────────────────────────
# evals/README.md's "Agent-side token ledger" section publishes what an MCP
# client pays per call, before and after the payload cuts. Unlike the
# accuracy tables above this needs no GPU — it is pure counting — so every
# cell is pinnable, and every cell is pinned.
# Promoted 2026-09-04 to r3 after the pre-merge review, twice over. r1
# measured the lean fact_get projection while it still dropped
# source_entries, and picked its widest slots from a 2,000-row prefix of
# the fact dump. r2 fixed both and then measured `superseded_by_text`
# truncated — a field with no recovery path, whose truncation was
# REMOVED before merge, so r2's headline priced a payload this repo does
# not ship. r3 prices the shipped one. r1 and r2 stay committed as
# pre-review records and are deliberately cited by nothing.

# The merge review of the re-judge found the promoted +0.040 / +0.042 is
# not spread evenly: one of the six types carries most of it under BOTH
# judges, and no doc said so. Every cell of the published table is COMPUTED
# from the judged rows here rather than read off the summaries' `types`
# blocks, because the load-bearing quantity is the NET row count (rows the
# hybrid arm wins minus rows the control wins), which no summary carries at
# all — the summaries hold per-arm per-type accuracies, whose difference
# would be a rounded restatement of a number computed elsewhere. Each judge
# reads its own file: the Qwen column off the source run's rows, the Opus
# column off the re-judge's, so neither can be edited to match the other.

# The prompt was rewritten by the same day's merge review AFTER the ladder
# gate had run, so every `post` row above measures text that is no longer
# shipped. `qwen-27b-assistprompt-post2.json` is the re-run on the shipped
# text and `…-post2-paired-verdict-threshold.json` its paired verdict; both
# tables publish the row, so both get pinned. Three things beyond the four
# cells are pinned because a reader cannot otherwise check them:
#   * the verdict's own `gate` / `no_regression_gate` / `failed_checks`,
#     which is the whole claim that the rewrite cost nothing;
#   * the `bench_env.dream.assistant_claims` stamp, present here for the
#     first time — a `Claim` expresses it fine as a 0/1 predicate, the same
#     shape the `gate == "FAIL"` rows above already use;
#   * its ABSENCE on the six earlier rung files, which the docs state
#     explicitly. A "the artifact does not carry X" sentence is as
#     falsifiable as a number and rots the same way.

# ── the same gate, re-run under speaker rule v2 (2026-09-05) ─────────────
#
# `sonnet_extractor_v4.md` is GENERATED from `_ASSISTANT_SPEAKER_RULE`, so
# the same day's rule rewrite changed the file the shim is launched with and
# the gate above stopped describing it. Only the POST arm was re-run (the v2
# pre comparator carries none of the assistant blocks, so the rewrite cannot
# reach it), which is why the verdict names a `post2` arm.
#
# One published statement deliberately does NOT reappear below: "an
# identical consolidation tally every time". It is true of the four rule-v1
# runs and false under rule v2, whose second replicate returned 17 claims —
# and inserted all 17. What is pinned instead is that claim count and its
# insert count, so the docs cannot quietly restate the stronger version.
