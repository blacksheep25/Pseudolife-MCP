"""Service-level cortex wiring: read/write/supersede/search roundtrips, history,
co-persistence, and contenders — the provenance guard surfaces a conflicting
agent value as a contender against a user fact, and resolve() promotes/retires
it.

Runs against a real MemoryService (offline embedder), never production state.
Most tests take conftest's shared ``pristine_service`` — the cortex is a
slot-keyed store and the fixture empties it per test, so a private data dir
buys nothing but a service construction. The three that DO build their own
service say why at the call site: two re-open a second service on the same
data dir, and one breaks the service's save path irreversibly.
