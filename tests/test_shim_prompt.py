"""The CLI shim's extraction prompt carries the shipped assistant-facts ask.

``evals/claude_shim.py --system-prompt-file`` REPLACES the shipped
``dream._SYSTEM_PROMPT`` prefix. On an install whose primary extractor is
the shim — the default since the 2026-07-11 cutover, and what ``ops/.env``
selects via ``PSEUDOLIFE_DREAM_BASE_URL=...:8082/v1`` — an instruction
added to ``_SYSTEM_PROMPT`` therefore never reaches the model. The
assistant-facts blocks that shipped on 2026-09-05 landed in that blind
spot; ``evals/prompts/sonnet_extractor_v4.md`` closes it.

These tests pin the two properties that make the fix real rather than a
copy: the file is v2 plus the SHIPPED blocks (imported, not retyped), and
every name-shaped phrase in the prompt body is either a registered invented
token or recorded debt inherited from v2.

That second property is weaker than it first read. The guard originally
grepped only the four registered ``EXAMPLE_TOKENS`` while its docstring
claimed the whole prompt, and the inherited v2 body carries worked examples
of its own — one of which names a LongMemEval answer.

The debt is recorded rather than hidden, in ``KNOWN_CORPUS_COLLISIONS``
(``evals/gen_shim_prompt.py``, beside the file that carries it). It was not
a shim-only debt when recorded (2026-09-05): the same example was in
``dream._SYSTEM_PROMPT``, so every extractor had it. The v12 base re-cut it
there on 2026-09-07, so it is a shim-lineage debt now, and
``tests/test_assistant_provenance.py`` runs the same two halves over the
shipped prompt against that module's own (empty) list. v2 is not re-cut
(it is the pre arm of a committed gate) and neither is v4 (the pre arm of
the v5 gate); ``sonnet_extractor_v5.md`` (2026-09-07) is the re-cut, held
below to an EMPTY collision list, and the launchers default to it.
