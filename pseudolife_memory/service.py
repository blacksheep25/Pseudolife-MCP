"""MemoryService — high-level wrapper over the Pseudolife memory stack.

One ``MemoryService`` per data directory. The MCP server (see
:mod:`pseudolife_memory.mcp_server`) holds a single instance for the
process lifetime and routes every MCP tool call through one of the
methods below. All methods return plain-JSON-serialisable dicts /
lists so the MCP layer can ``json.dumps`` them without further work.

Design notes
------------
* **No LLM dependency.** Reflection / HyDE were dropped from this build —
  Claude is the LLM, so the natural way to reflect is for Claude to call
  ``memory_store`` with a summary it composes itself (and, since the
  auto-outcome stage, for the dream to infer what a session never logged).

* **No silent fallbacks.** Pseudolife's chat path swallows memory errors so
  the user's conversation never breaks. For an MCP tool Claude is calling
  deliberately, errors should surface — so this layer lets exceptions
  propagate and the MCP server converts them into structured error
  responses.

* **Source = tag.** The MCP exposes a ``source`` parameter on every store
  for free-form tagging ("pseudolife", "general", "v0.7.6"). Retrieval can
  filter by source list. Multi-tag support could land later as a
  schema-versioned addition.

* **Lazy init.** Embedder + CMS are constructed on the first method call,
  not in ``__init__``. Keeps the MCP startup fast (Claude's tool list
  loads even if torch / sentence-transformers are slow to warm up).

          eviction/promotion scoring). Raise it to enable dedup of
          near-duplicate stores.
        * Smaller embedder batch size: MCP calls one-at-a-time, no point
          paying the warmup overhead of a large batch.
        * Meta-filter OFF: it exists to drop auto-captured chat noise;
          every MCP store is a deliberate tool call.
        * Recency base half-life 24h (vs 1h): Claude Code sessions are
          hours-to-days apart, so a 1h half-life made the recency boost
          effectively always zero.
        * retention_boost 1.0: graded MTT retention on for the daemon (library default 0.0).

        Leaves the MIRAS preset alone — the ``continuum`` 8-tier default

        ``return_event_id=True`` adds ``retrieval_event_id`` (the id of the
        retrieval-log row this search wrote) to the result, so the caller
        can attach the fact half of the response via
        :meth:`attach_served_facts`. Opt-in on purpose: the id is training
        plumbing, not part of the public search shape, and must not leak
        through recall/Console callers. Absent when the log is disabled or
        the write failed.

        ``sources`` and ``bands`` filter the result set: only entries whose
        ``source`` / ``bank`` match the supplied list survive. ``None`` means
        no filter on that axis.

        ``min_score`` overrides the relevance keep-threshold (default 0.25).
        Lower it to widen recall when the bank is sparse; raise it to drop
        weak hits. ``disable_recency_boost=True`` short-circuits the
        per-band recency uplift so ranking depends on raw similarity ×
        source-multiplier × supersession only — useful for state-probe
        queries where popularity bias is unwelcome.

        ``rerank`` overrides ``config.memory.reranker.enabled``:

        * ``None`` (default) — follow the config flag.
        * ``True`` — apply the cross-encoder reranker on the top-N
          candidates even if config disables it. First call lazy-loads
          ``cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`` (~80MB).
        * ``False`` — skip reranking even if config enables it.

        ``bm25`` overrides ``config.memory.bm25.enabled``:

        * ``None`` (default) — follow the config flag.
        * ``True`` — run BM25 sparse-lexical retrieval in parallel with
          the dense pool and fuse the two. Catches exact-keyword queries
          (function names, version strings, error codes) that dense
          retrieval can underweight. Pure-stdlib, no extra deps.
        * ``False`` — skip BM25 even if config enables it.

        ``contiguity_neighbors`` overrides
        ``config.memory.search.contiguity_neighbors`` (``None`` follows
        config): when > 0, each hit also surfaces up to that many
        stream-adjacent neighbors per side — same episode, else same
        source — placed around their parent hit in timestamp order and
        marked ``"via": "contiguity"`` with score 0.0. Passing an
        explicit ``0`` pins vanilla retrieval regardless of config (the
        eval harness's control arm relies on this).

        ``timeline`` overrides ``config.memory.search.timeline_channel``
        (``None`` follows config): when on and the query carries a
        temporal cue, lexically-relevant entries are injected (marked
        ``"via": "timeline"``) and the memory portion of the result is
        ordered by stream position instead of score. Explicit ``False``
        pins vanilla retrieval (control-arm contract, as above).

        Two modes:

          retrieval through the standard CMS pipeline (so filters /
          rerank / BM25 all apply), then cluster the top-N hits by
          mutual similarity. Returns clusters scoped to the topic.
        * **Episode-scoped** (``query=None``, ``episode`` given): walk
          the episode's entries directly, treat them as the candidate
          pool, cluster. Returns clusters within the session — useful
          for "summarise what we worked on" style consolidation.

        The clustering algorithm is exposed in
        :mod:`pseudolife_memory.memory.consolidation`. This method is

            query: Topic to consolidate around. None when episode-scoping.
            episode: Restrict to this episode id. AND-combined with the
                tag / source filters.
            sources / tags: Same semantics as ``search``.
            top_k: Max candidates considered. Beyond this, the candidate
                pool is too noisy for clustering to be meaningful.
            min_cohesion: Min cosine between seed and cluster member.
                Default 0.6 is conservative — surface only clearly-
                related groups.
            min_cluster_size: Drop clusters with fewer members.
                Default 2 (the natural floor).
            max_clusters: Hard cap on returned clusters.
