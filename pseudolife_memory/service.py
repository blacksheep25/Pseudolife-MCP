"""MemoryService — high-level wrapper over the Pseudolife memory stack.

One ``MemoryService`` per data directory. The MCP server (see
:mod:`pseudolife_memory.mcp_server`) holds a single instance for the
process lifetime and routes every MCP tool call through one of the
methods below. All methods return plain-JSON-serialisable dicts /
lists so the MCP layer can ``json.dumps`` them without further work.

Design notes
------------
* **No LLM dependency.** Reflection / HyDE were dropped from this build —
  Claude is the LLM, so the natural way to reflect is for Claude to call
  ``memory_store`` with a summary it composes itself (and, since the
  auto-outcome stage, for the dream to infer what a session never logged).

* **No silent fallbacks.** Pseudolife's chat path swallows memory errors so
  the user's conversation never breaks. For an MCP tool Claude is calling
  deliberately, errors should surface — so this layer lets exceptions
  propagate and the MCP server converts them into structured error
  responses.

* **Source = tag.** The MCP exposes a ``source`` parameter on every store
  for free-form tagging ("pseudolife", "general", "v0.7.6"). Retrieval can
  filter by source list. Multi-tag support could land later as a
  schema-versioned addition.

* **Lazy init.** Embedder + CMS are constructed on the first method call,
  not in ``__init__``. Keeps the MCP startup fast (Claude's tool list
  loads even if torch / sentence-transformers are slow to warm up).

          eviction/promotion scoring). Raise it to enable dedup of

        * Smaller embedder batch size: MCP calls one-at-a-time, no point
          paying the warmup overhead of a large batch.
        * Meta-filter OFF: it exists to drop auto-captured chat noise;
          every MCP store is a deliberate tool call.
        * Recency base half-life 24h (vs 1h): Claude Code sessions are
          hours-to-days apart, so a 1h half-life made the recency boost
          effectively always zero.

        ``tags`` (schema v6) is an optional multi-valued label list.
        Normalised by the underlying CMS (lowercased / stripped /
        deduped). Tags exist alongside ``source``, not as a replacement.

        ``origin`` (``"user"`` / ``"action"`` / ``"agent"``) records who asserted
        any canonical facts auto-promoted from this text into the cortex. When
        omitted it is defaulted from ``source`` (conversation->user, claude->
        agent, tool->action). See :meth:`_promote_slots`.

        ``episode`` (identity tier 2, spec 2026-07-18): an open episode id or
        unambiguous prefix (>=8 chars) — attributes this entry to that
        episode. A header session (tier 1) still wins overall identity, but
        the entry's ``episode_id`` targets the handle regardless. An unknown/
        closed/ambiguous handle degrades silently: the store still proceeds,
        and ``"episode_warning"`` is added to the result.

        Returns ``{"stored": bool, "surprise": float, "reason": str|None,
        "cortex_promoted": int}``. Stores can be rejected by either the
        meta-filter (looks like self-reference) or the surprise gate (already
        known) — the ``reason`` field surfaces which.

        ``authority`` / ``distortion_tolerance`` (schema v35): the write-time
        label pair. ``"auto"`` (default) runs the deterministic heuristic in
        :mod:`pseudolife_memory.memory.labels` over ``text``; an explicit
        value is validated (``ValueError`` on junk). A fresh store has
        nothing to inherit from, so an unresolved ``auto`` is NULL. The
        applied labels ride back on the result only when set.

        ``return_event_id=True`` adds ``retrieval_event_id`` (the id of the
        retrieval-log row this search wrote) to the result, so the caller
        can attach the fact half of the response via
        :meth:`attach_served_facts`. Opt-in on purpose: the id is training
        plumbing, not part of the public search shape, and must not leak
        through recall/Console callers. Absent when the log is disabled or
        the write failed.

        ``sources`` and ``bands`` filter the result set: only entries whose
        ``source`` / ``bank`` match the supplied list survive. ``None`` means
        no filter on that axis.

        ``min_score`` overrides the relevance keep-threshold (default 0.25).
        Lower it to widen recall when the bank is sparse; raise it to drop
        weak hits. ``disable_recency_boost=True`` short-circuits the
        per-band recency uplift so ranking depends on raw similarity ×
        source-multiplier × supersession only — useful for state-probe
        queries where popularity bias is unwelcome.

        ``rerank`` overrides ``config.memory.reranker.enabled``:

        * ``None`` (default) — follow the config flag.
        * ``True`` — apply the cross-encoder reranker on the top-N
          candidates even if config disables it. First call lazy-loads
          ``cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`` (~80MB).
        * ``False`` — skip reranking even if config enables it.

        ``bm25`` overrides ``config.memory.bm25.enabled``:

        * ``None`` (default) — follow the config flag.
        * ``True`` — run BM25 sparse-lexical retrieval in parallel with
          the dense pool and fuse the two. Catches exact-keyword queries
          (function names, version strings, error codes) that dense
          retrieval can underweight. Pure-stdlib, no extra deps.
        * ``False`` — skip BM25 even if config enables it.

        ``contiguity_neighbors`` overrides
        ``config.memory.search.contiguity_neighbors`` (``None`` follows
        config): when > 0, each hit also surfaces up to that many
        stream-adjacent neighbors per side — same episode, else same
        source — placed around their parent hit in timestamp order and
        marked ``"via": "contiguity"`` with score 0.0. Passing an
        explicit ``0`` pins vanilla retrieval regardless of config (the
        eval harness's control arm relies on this).

        ``timeline`` overrides ``config.memory.search.timeline_channel``
        (``None`` follows config): when on and the query carries a
        temporal cue, lexically-relevant entries are injected (marked
        ``"via": "timeline"``) and the memory portion of the result is
        ordered by stream position instead of score. Explicit ``False``
        pins vanilla retrieval (control-arm contract, as above).

        ``support`` records who asserted the fact — ``"user"`` (the human stated

        agent merely said it). It accumulates on the record (``origin`` = the
        strongest tier seen), so corroboration is first-class.

        ``episode`` (identity tier 2): an open episode id or unambiguous
        prefix (>=8 chars). Facts have no separate attribution field, so a
        valid handle IS the identity for this call — it becomes the

        *contender* and a ``"current"`` key carries the canonical value that won,
        so the caller sees both sides of the conflict.

        ``authority`` / ``distortion_tolerance`` (v35): ``"auto"`` runs the
        deterministic heuristic over ``value`` and falls back to INHERIT
        (keep what the slot has); the dream passes the source entry's label

        rollback's post-revert check).

        Alias-aware in both directions: on a direct slot miss, the entity
        name is resolved through the graph's ``entity_aliases`` (Postgres)
        and the canonical name is retried, then each of the node's aliases.
        So a fact stored under ``dev-box`` surfaces when the caller queries
        the alias ``4090``, and a fact the dream wrote under ``pr-235``
        surfaces under ``PR #235`` once a merge has folded that name into
        the node — the same attachment ``graph_neighborhood`` makes, so the
        name recall shows a fact under is a name that fetches it. Order is
        direct hit, canonical, aliases (``find_entity``'s alias order), so a
        canonical-keyed record wins over an alias-keyed one at the same
        attribute; the served record keeps its OWN slot key, which is where
        its traces, contenders and ``correct_with`` live. An alias that is
        also another entity's canonical is skipped — ``find_entity`` would
        resolve it to that entity, so a record under it is theirs (see
        ``_alias_retry_names``). One ``find_entity`` call per miss plus,
        only when the node has aliases, one indexed shadow probe — never a
        per-alias storage query. Aliases are graph norms
        (``graph.norm_name``), so a record whose entity the cortex normalizer
        keeps distinct (``host:port`` vs ``host-port``) is not reached this
        way — the limit the canonical retry has always had.

        A set-valued slot has no single ``current`` record to return, so it
        takes a different shape: ``{"kind": "set", "entity", "attribute",
        "members": [...], "removed": [...]}`` (current members / removed
        audit rows). Checked only on a scalar miss, over the same name list

        write a correction NOW: an unclearable flag there is a standing
        instruction to rewrite a quarter of the cortex, every session.
        Keying on ``last_confirmed`` means the documented remedy —
        re-assert the slot, which confirms it and moves the clock — is
        exactly what silences it.

        The keys are ABSENT on unaffected facts, keeping their payloads
        byte-identical (the ``stance`` precedent in
        ``_cortex_record_to_dict``).

        BEST-EFFORT, and deliberately so. The flag is derived at read time
        from evidence that still exists, so LOSING the evidence loses the
        flag: ``memory_traces.entry_id`` is ``ON DELETE CASCADE``, a
        true-drop capacity eviction hard-deletes the entry row (every
        eviction under the default flat preset), and a superseded entry is
        the top eviction candidate because contradiction decay multiplies
        its surprise by 0.3. So a flag can appear and later vanish with no
        re-verification having happened, and ``memory_delete`` — the
        strongest retraction of all — raises no flag at any point. Making
        the caution outlive its evidence needs durable per-slot state, i.e.
        a schema change, which is out of scope here; both behaviours are
        pinned by tests so the limit is a recorded contract rather than a
        surprise. Caller holds the lock."""

        A set slot is served as ONE grouped dict with no scalar record
        behind it, so this lookup payload carried neither the
        ``source_entries`` the scalar path fetches nor a confirmation stamp
        (``cortex_search``'s grouped entry has carried ``last_confirmed``
        since the Task-6 review; it lacked only the traces). Either way no
        set slot could carry ``re_verify``, while ``slots_for_entries``
        (kind-agnostic) named set slots in ``derived_flagged`` and
        ``memory_fact_get`` promised the flag without qualification.

        The cross-index is keyed on the SLOT, not the member, so one
        ``traces_for_slot`` answers for the whole set. The slot's
        confirmation stamp is the newest member's, which makes the flag
        clearable the way the scalar path's ``last_confirmed`` does — but
        bluntly: ADDING a member also stamps the slot, so an unrelated add
        silences the caution for members nobody re-checked. Accepted rather
        than keyed to confirmations only, because a set slot is a single
        served answer and a per-member flag on a grouped payload has
        nowhere to render. ``_annotate_recalled_facts``, where members ARE
        served individually, matches per member instead. Only the flag keys
        are merged out, so the set payload does not otherwise change shape.
        Gated on ``traces.enabled`` before the query, not after: unlike the
        scalar path — which SERVES its traces as ``source_entries`` and so
        fetches them either way — this lookup is purely feeding the
        annotation and discards the result, so with the cross-index off the
        query is pure waste. ``test_flag_off_when_the_cross_index_is_disabled``

        — one string scan per constraint-labelled current scalar; no
        second embedding pass, no index to keep fresh). In-scope
        constraints go FIRST, marked ``pinned: True``, ahead of better-
        scoring ranked facts — but pinning is exemption from RANKING, not
        from relevance: a pin must clear the caller's ``min_score`` floor
        (``memory_search`` passes ``guard_min_score``, whose whole job is
        to stop weak facts being asserted as canonical), pins take at most
        ``max(1, top_k // 2)`` of the budget so the ranked answer always
        keeps the rest, and among pins the best cosine wins the slots
        (the least relevant rules are dropped, not the newest). The
        peer review of 2026-09-02 reproduced the unbounded version: six
        rules on one entity displaced the whole block at cosine ~0.37
        against a 0.5 floor. A pinned fact that never made the ranked
        list is served in the identical shape with its true cosine as
        ``score``, so the reader can see that it was pinned. No constraint
        labels in the bank → the input is returned untouched, so an
        unlabelled bank is served byte-identically. Set members carry no
        labels in v1 and are never pinned. Runs BEFORE ``_demote_stale``
        on purpose: under ``stale_policy="demote"`` a stale (slow /
        volatile) constraint sinks below the fresh ranked facts — the
        staleness policy is a trust decision and outranks the pin; the
        default ``evergreen`` never goes stale, so this only bites on a
        constraint the writer also marked transient."""

        Two modes:

          retrieval through the standard CMS pipeline (so filters /
          rerank / BM25 all apply), then cluster the top-N hits by
          mutual similarity. Returns clusters scoped to the topic.
        * **Episode-scoped** (``query=None``, ``episode`` given): walk
          the episode's entries directly, treat them as the candidate
          pool, cluster. Returns clusters within the session — useful
          for "summarise what we worked on" style consolidation.

        The clustering algorithm is exposed in
        :mod:`pseudolife_memory.memory.consolidation`. This method is

            query: Topic to consolidate around. None when episode-scoping.
            episode: Restrict to this episode id. AND-combined with the
                tag / source filters.
            sources / tags: Same semantics as ``search``.
            top_k: Max candidates considered. Beyond this, the candidate
                pool is too noisy for clustering to be meaningful.
            min_cohesion: Min cosine between seed and cluster member.
                Default 0.6 is conservative — surface only clearly-
                related groups.
            min_cluster_size: Drop clusters with fewer members.
                Default 2 (the natural floor).
            max_clusters: Hard cap on returned clusters.

        """Carry ``re_verify`` onto the facts ``recall`` serves, in place.

        ``recall`` reaches canonical facts through the graph projection, not
        the cortex block, so without this the SAME fact reads as cautioned
        via ``memory_search`` and clean via ``memory_recall`` — an
        inconsistency between adjacent read paths that is worse than either
        behaviour alone.

        Annotated HERE rather than in ``graph_neighborhood``, which recall
        composes: that method also backs the Console's Atlas and the whole-
        graph view, where the facts are a label on a node rather than an
        answer being acted on, and where the node set is capped in the
        hundreds. Scoping the work to recall keeps it to one batched trace
        query plus one evidence query per call, whatever the graph's size.

        Facts are matched back to their slot on ``(entity, attribute,
        VALUE)``. The entity side is the record's entity RESOLVED through
        the alias table — the same name ``graph_neighborhood`` attached the
        fact under. The node's entity is the canonical and the record's may
        be an alias of it (a merge folds the absorbed canonical into the
        survivor's aliases without rewriting the record), and ``norm_name``
        of the two differ, so keying on the raw record entity would miss
        exactly the alias-attached facts and silently drop their caution.
        The recall side of the key is a node's DISPLAY name (``run_recall``
        keys ``entity_facts`` by ``node["entity"]``), which a later display
        enrichment can leave normalizing to neither canonical nor alias
        (``GND (Enshrouded server)`` over ``gnd``), so that side resolves
        canonical → alias → display; the record side keeps ``find_entity``
        semantics, since a record's entity is an arbitrary string rather
        than a node label. The value is what makes the match sound. The
        graph normalizes
        names with ``graph.norm_name`` and the cross-index with
        ``cortex._norm_key``, and the two fold DIFFERENT separator classes —
        ``norm_name`` folds ``:``, ``_norm_key`` folds ``-`` and leaves
        ``:`` alone — so ``host:port`` and ``host-port`` are two distinct
        cortex slots hanging off ONE graph node, and
        ``graph_neighborhood`` puts both slots' facts on it. Matching on
        entity and attribute alone therefore annotates both against
        whichever slot won the tie: a missed correction on one, a
        correction from the wrong slot's evidence on the other. The value
        separates them, and where it does not (two records identical in all
        three) the slots are interchangeable for this purpose anyway. Alias
        resolution widens that tie a little: two slots that differ only by
        the alias they were written under (``pr-235`` and ``pr-#235``, same
        attribute and value) now share a key, and post-merge those are the
        same fact written twice, so the same tie-break applies. A set
        slot's members each match on their own value, so a member is
        cleared by ITS own re-confirmation rather than the slot's newest.

        Only the flag keys are written onto the served fact; the
        ``source_entries`` the traversal needs stay on a probe, since a
        recalled fact is a label and would double in size carrying them.

        Cost: one graph load for the alias table (the same load
        ``graph_neighborhood`` makes per hop), one batched trace query and
        one evidence query per call — and one pass over
        ``current_records()`` with two normalizations per record, which is
        the same sweep ``graph_neighborhood`` has already made to assemble
        these facts. ``recall`` holds no lock of its own, so this takes
        it."""
