"""Graph logic — normalization, ontology-lite validation, on-read inference.

Pure functions over plain data (no storage, no torch) so the weak-model
guardrails (spec §5.3) are testable without Postgres:

* :func:`norm_name` — deterministic normalization (lowercase, separators
  folded to ``-``) so weak-model variants (``depends_on`` / ``Depends On``)
  resolve to the registry name without ever erroring.
* :func:`resolve_relation` — closed-vocabulary check with top-3 fuzzy
  suggestions on miss ("did you mean 'depends-on'?").
* :func:`derive_edges` — transitive closure + inverse mirroring computed
  at query time. Derived edges return marked ``derived: True`` with rule
  provenance (``via: ["transitive:depends-on"]``) so a weak model receives
  complete multi-hop conclusions as plain facts — the server does the
  reasoning, the model does the reading. No stored materialization, no
  invalidation problem: the graph is small enough to derive on read.
* :func:`build_subgraph` — depth-capped neighborhood (≤ 3 hops) +
  optional path between two named entities, via NetworkX.

    (``load_graph()``'s ``entities`` + ``aliases``), with the precedence
    ``PostgresStorage.find_entity`` applies: canonical first, then alias.
    An alias that coincides with some entity's canonical is dropped, since
    ``find_entity`` resolves that name to the canonical's owner and never
    reaches the alias row. ``m.get(n, n)`` therefore resolves any
    normalized name exactly as ``find_entity`` would, or leaves it alone —
    one dict per call in place of a storage lookup per record.

    Why the read surfaces need it: a fact's ``entity`` string is whatever
    its writer used, and a later merge turns the absorbed node's canonical
    into an alias of the survivor without rewriting the record. Matching
    ``norm_name(rec.entity)`` against a node's canonical alone then drops
    every fact written under the folded name (live bank, 2026-09-02:
    ``pr-235`` merged into ``PR #235``; ``memory_fact_get`` on the alias
