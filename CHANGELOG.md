# Changelog

All notable changes to Pseudolife-MCP are documented here. The format is based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed (2026-09-01 — RE evidence integrity review)
- **RE evidence artifacts are now fully immutable at the PostgreSQL
  boundary.** The maintenance-SQL trigger previously protected only project
  and build scope, allowing bytes, payload, locator, and a matching hash to be
  forged together underneath already-verified claims. Every artifact update is
  now rejected; regression probes cover all stored content and metadata.
- **Claim updates preserve evidence links when `evidence_ids` is omitted.** An
  explicit list still replaces the complete set and `[]` explicitly clears it,
  preventing a downgrade to `hypothesis` from silently discarding provenance.
  Concurrent artifact replay now returns a clean input error if the conflicting
  row disappears before verification instead of dereferencing `None`.
- **RE evidence documentation surfaces are current:** Atlas tool counts and
  Console panels include the 36th/core-23 RE tool, and the toolset description
  advertises strict RE evidence.

### Added (2026-08-31 — strict reverse-engineering evidence pilot)
- **Added the independently versioned `v34-rehub` reverse-engineering proof
  store and the core-tier
  `re_evidence` tool.** Evidence Hub JSON artifacts are retained immutably with
  an original-byte SHA-256, exact address index, project/build attribution, and
  replay deduplication. Behavioral claims live separately and cannot be marked
  `observed`, `verified`, or `rejected` without project-local evidence links.
  Exact build-scoped query, compact/raw payload modes, project stats, and a
  hash-verified portable ZIP export/import make the feature optional and
  removable. These tables are outside
  associative memory, the reference bank, cortex promotion, and dream
  consolidation, so a remembered inference cannot silently become proof. The
  extension records `rehub_schema_version` separately and leaves upstream's
  integer `schema_version` at v34, avoiding collisions with future upstream
  migrations. General memory transfer explicitly excludes these proof tables;
  they travel only through the feature's hash-validated archive format.
- **The Cortex Console now has a read-only RE Evidence view.** It exposes
  project/build scopes, artifact and claim totals, claim-status breakdowns,
  search and status filters, immutable hashes, structured addresses, source
  paths, and evidence links without copying proof records into ordinary
  memory, cortex, the graph, or dream consolidation.

### Added (2026-08-31 — installer wiring for the Codex dreamer)
- **`codex-only` / `codex-fallback` extractor modes** in `ops/install.sh`
  / `ops\install.ps1`: the one-shot installer now wires a ChatGPT-plan
  dreamer end to end — GPT-5.6 model prompt (Sol / Terra / Luna, Terra
  default, menus honestly marked unmeasured), env triple at the Codex
  shim's `:8086`, sidecar skip for `-only` (shared with `sonnet-only`;
  the managed-override marker is generalized, with the legacy
  `(sonnet-only)` text still recognized so pre-codex installs keep
  switching modes cleanly), and autostart registration via the new
  `ops/install-codex-shim-autostart.ps1` (Task Scheduler) /
  `.sh` (systemd `--user`, docker-bridge bind). A `-Model`/`--model` from
  the wrong family (e.g. `claude-*` with a codex mode) is rejected up
  front instead of silently serving the shim's launch default.
  `-ShimPort`/`--shim-port` default is now `0` = auto (8082 for Claude
  modes, 8086 for Codex ones). A mode switch tears down the other
  family's autostart task/unit (an abandoned shim would keep making real
  CLI calls at every health refresh on a plan its owner believes is
  off), and a shim mode whose CLI is missing now fails fast right after
  the extractor choice instead of dying at the autostart stage with the
  stack already up — preflight only knows `--client`, so
  `--extractor codex-fallback --client claude` used to sail through.
- **`codex_shim.py --health-ttl`** (default unchanged at 300 s; the
  autostart passes 1800 s): every `/health` refresh is a real CLI call —
  metered spend on a free ChatGPT tier (~288 calls/day at 300 s) — and a
  stale-ok window only costs one failed primary attempt before fallback.
  The shim also resolves the official Windows installer's `codex.exe`
  on its own (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenAI\Codex\bin\<hash>\`, off PATH,
  rotating on auto-update — newest wins at every start; verified live
  2026-08-31), and `ops/preflight.ps1`'s codex check accepts that layout
  instead of failing a working install. Live smoke 2026-08-31 against
  codex-cli 0.151.0-alpha on a free tier: health warm-up,
  production-prompt extraction (Luna), and per-request model switch
  (Terra) all pass.

### Added (2026-08-31 — Codex CLI shim: dream on a ChatGPT plan)
- **`evals/codex_shim.py`** — the OpenAI-side twin of the Claude CLI shim:
  wraps headless `codex exec` (signed-in Codex CLI, ChatGPT-plan included
  usage, no API key) as an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` on
  `127.0.0.1:8086`, serving `gpt-5.6-terra` by default. The request's
  system message rides `-c model_instructions_file=` (replacing Codex's
  coding-agent persona), the reply is parsed from the `--json` event
  stream so a failed turn raises instead of masquerading as an empty
  extraction, and agent affordances are disabled (`--sandbox read-only`,
  `--ephemeral`, no web search or shell tool). Honours a concrete `gpt-*`
  / `codex-*` model named per request — the Console Dreamer card switches
  it live, mirroring the Claude shim's `claude-*` handling. Registered as
  the `terra` ladder rung (out of `LADDER_ORDER`, like `sonnet-5`).
  Originates from the 2026-07-21 `feat/terra-shim` branch, updated for the
  per-request model contract and moved off :8083 (now the opus-5 ceiling
  rung's port) to :8086 (:8085 was already the events-teacher shim default
  in `distill_datagen_events.py`). Not wired into the autostart installers, and extraction
  quality is unmeasured pending a `--rung terra` ladder run; verified by
  its test suite against the documented `codex exec --json` contract, not
  yet against a live Codex install.

### Changed (2026-08-31 — Dreamer presentation: non-Claude models are first-class)
- **The Console no longer reads as Claude-only.** A real external adopter
  on an OpenAI stack concluded from the Dreamer panel that other
  providers' models "aren't an option" — the backend was always
  provider-neutral (the override and extractor model knobs are plain
  strings any OpenAI-compatible endpoint consumes). The custom-model
  input's placeholder is now neutral (`model id…`, was `claude-…`), the
  Dreamer card gains one-click GPT-5.6 presets (Sol / Terra / Luna,
  honestly marked unmeasured), and the Dreamer help line plus the
  `extractor_model_override` / `extractor_base_url` / `extractor_model`
  knob help state plainly that any model id the wired endpoint serves
  works (LM Studio/Ollama/vLLM names included), with `claude-*` /
  `gpt-*` per-request switching as the shim special cases.
  `docs/guide/dreaming.md` gains the matching "OpenAI primary" section.
### Fixed (2026-08-31 — claude_shim: a timed-out call can no longer wedge the shim)
- **`evals/claude_shim.py` now kills the whole process tree on a call
  timeout.** The shim ran each call via `subprocess.run(..., timeout=...)`,
  whose timeout path kills only the direct child and then reaps it with an
  unbounded `communicate()`. The `claude` CLI is a node program behind a
  wrapper (`claude.cmd` → `cmd.exe` → node on Windows; a shell shim on
  POSIX), so a surviving descendant holding the stdout pipe made that reap
  block forever — with the shim's serialization lock held, wedging every
  later call, including the daemon's dream primary on :8082. Calls now go
  through a `Popen`/`communicate` seam that detaches the child into its own
  session on POSIX (`start_new_session`) and, on timeout, kills the tree
  (`os.killpg` on POSIX, `taskkill /F /T` on Windows) before reaping — the
  same structure as `codex_shim.py`. No behavior change outside the timeout
  path. (`evals/claude_shim.py`, `tests/test_claude_shim_health.py`.)

### Added (2026-08-31 — logical export/import: `pseudolife-mcp export` / `import`)
- **The bank now has a logical transfer layer beside the physical backups.**
  `pseudolife-mcp export` writes the whole bank as a portable ZIP — one
  JSONL file per table plus a manifest (format version, schema version,
  embedding dimension, per-table counts) — from a single read-only
  REPEATABLE READ snapshot, safe against a live daemon.
  `pseudolife-mcp import <archive.zip>` loads one into a **fresh, empty
  bank** in a single transaction, preserving ids, HLC stamps, and
  embeddings verbatim and advancing the id sequences past the imported
  rows. Unlike a `pg_dump`, the artifact is deployment-tier- and
  Postgres-version-independent and loads additively across schema
  versions: an export missing a column takes the target's DDL default
  (old export → new build), while an export carrying an unknown column is
  refused (new export → old build would silently drop data). Import also
  refuses a non-empty bank, refuses while other connections hold the
  database (a running daemon; `--force` overrides), and refuses an
  embedding-dimension mismatch. Every schema table is explicitly
  classified exported or excluded (operational telemetry and the dream
  run journal stay behind; the manifest lists them), and the roster is
  guard-tested against `BENCH_RESET_TABLES` so a future table must pick
  a side. Both commands are torch-free and resolve the bank the way
  `backup` does (explicit DSN, else the lite tier's embedded instance).
  (`pseudolife_memory/transfer_cli.py`, `tests/test_transfer_cli.py`;
  docs in the configuration guide's Backups section.)

### Added (2026-08-31 — judge ladder measures the caution-line prompt variant)
- **`evals/judge_ladder.py --caution`** re-runs the frozen merge-judge
  fixture with `low_differential` computed on each row's shown snippets
  (the two defect classes of the 2026-08-21 shadow comparison: an empty
  side, or shown overlap at or above 50%), so the judge prompt carries the
  production caution line that ships since the snippet-differential fix.
  Production's third stamping criterion — pool containment, computed on
  pre-truncation evidence pools — is deliberately out of the ladder's
  reach: the frozen fixture stores only the shown snippets, so the flag
  mirrors exactly the metric the shadow comparison measured.
  Flags reach the prompt only under `--caution`; every arm's record now
  also reports paired `flagged_subset` / `clean_subset` metrics plus a
  per-row `caution` marker, so a baseline arm slices directly against a
  caution arm. Unflagged and baseline rows serialize byte-identically to
  the frozen fixture (40 of its 129 rows flag). A `--max-tokens` knob
  (default unchanged at 400) raises the verdict budget for high
  reasoning-effort arms: at xhigh the trace overflows the default budget
  plus the +4096 thinking headroom and whole batches return truncated or
  empty JSON — the 2026-08-31 xhigh run truncated away 30 of the 30 true-accept rows (batches 0-3)
  identically in both replicates. `--only-flagged` restricts a run to the
  flagged rows — the token-frugal subset for paired caution-line checks
  on a metered judge (the subset split is omitted there: every row is
  flagged, so the top-level metrics ARE the flagged subset).

### Fixed (2026-08-30 — merge-proposal evidence: no more empty sides, differential snippets, low-differential flag)
- **Every merge-proposal side now ships evidence, and the two sides stop
  showing each other's.** The 2026-08-21 live shadow comparison
  (`evals/results/judge-shadow-live-20260821.json`) found 40 of 109 pending
  merge proposals (37%) carried low-differential evidence — one side had no
  snippets, or the sides shared at least half of them. Three causes, all in
  `_attach_candidate_snippets`: the fallback read the vector-eligibility
  `mentions` map, so entities below `min_entity_mentions` or over
  `max_fallback_mentions` (caps that guard vectors, not display) shipped
  "evidence: none"; trace ids pointing at pruned entries blocked the
  fallback while resolving to nothing; and both sides took the same
  sorted-first-k mention entries, which for co-mentioned merge candidates are
  the same entries. Snippet pools now filter traces to live entries, fall
  back to a bounded token scan when the mentions map has nothing, and each
  side leads with entries exclusive to it, using shared entries only as
  filler. Link candidates keep pool order untouched: their question is
  "what relation holds?", which the co-occurrence notes answer, so demoting
  shared entries there would strip the evidence. Replaying the 2026-08-30
  live queue through the real enrichment path
  (`evals/snippet_differential_replay.py`, artifact
  `evals/results/snippet-differential-live-20260830.json`) drops the
  low-differential evidence share on the live queue from 36% (55 of 152)
  to 12% (18 of 152), with zero empty sides remaining.
- **Merge pairs whose evidence genuinely cannot distinguish them now say
  so.** Merge rows carry `evidence_overlap` plus `low_differential: true`
  when a side is empty, the shown snippets overlap at or above 50% — the
  shadow comparison's own metric — or one side's evidence pool is wholly
  contained in the other's (the bare-vs-qualified shape, where
  exclusive-first selection would otherwise hide that a side has no
  evidence of its own; 54 of the 152 live rows carry the flag). The
  Step-C judge prompt renders a caution line for flagged proposals.
  An absent flag serializes byte-identically, so the frozen judge-ladder
  fixtures and every published judge number keep their exact prompts —
  but the flagged prompt variant itself is NOT covered by the 2026-08-16
  ladder (which has no low-differential labels); the deployed judge runs
  in shadow mode and accepts are never auto-applied, and a ladder slice
  over flagged rows is deferred until the next judged run is asked for.
  Filing-time routing of thin proposals was considered and deliberately
  not shipped: evidence accrues after filing, so a filing-time verdict
  would go stale exactly like the stored fold direction already does.

### Added (2026-08-30 — shadow-judge evidence committed; `judge_mode` surfaced in the Console)
- **`memory.deep_dream.judge_mode` is now a Console knob** (new "Deep
  dream" group, enum `off | shadow | auto-reject`, live — the sweep
  re-reads config on every batch): flipping a live daemon no longer takes
  a container exec into `/data/config.yaml`. The shipped default stays
  `shadow`, and the knob's help text carries the caveat that gates the
  flip: auto-reject is only measured-safe on an Opus-class judge endpoint
  (the 2026-08-16 judge ladder shows weaker judges mis-rejecting with
  confident scores).
- **The 2026-08-21 live shadow-vs-triage comparison is committed**
  (`evals/results/judge-shadow-live-20260821.json`): the deployed Step-C
  judge scored against a fresh blind triage of all 109 then-pending merge
  proposals. At the deployed 0.8 confidence gate the live
  auto-reject precision is **1.000** — zero of the
  76/109 proposals cleared automatically would have been wrong — with
  overall agreement 0.927, and every one of the 8 disagreements sat at
  confidence ≤ 0.7, strictly below the gate. The judge's
  accept precision is only 0.611, so auto-accept remains unsafe and
  nothing implements it. This artifact is the evidence behind flipping the
  *deployed* daemon's `memory.deep_dream.judge_mode` to `auto-reject`; the
  shipped default stays `shadow`, which the 2026-08-16 judge ladder showed
  is the only safe default for arbitrary judge endpoints.
- **The 74-row Qwen3.8 slice working copies are promoted with their
  strict-MC re-score** — the condition the 2026-08-25 audit set before any
  number from them could be quoted. Rows 57–74 complete
  `lme-v2-smoke-qwen38-slice.jsonl`; its summary, the compose-prompt run,
  and the uniform-judge-parse rescore (`…-fixjudge.*`) land exactly as the
  runs left them, beside new `*-rescored-strictmc.*` correction artifacts
  (originals untouched, per the canonical-file rule; the fixjudge run's
  eval rows are identical to the base slice's — only the judge parse
  differs — so it shares that correction summary). The
  headline correction: the working copy's paired74 cortex delta
  +0.0946 (8W/1L, sign-test p 0.0391) — briefly the first significant
  3.8 > 3.6 result on this bench — does not survive the scorer fix:
  re-scored it is **+0.0405** (5W/2L, p 0.453). It is retired here
  without ever having been published.
- **Two KU-oracle summaries for the `arm1-mtp` determinism runs**
  (`longmemeval-ku-oracle-e4b-ft-arm1-mtp{,-r2}.summary.json`) — the runs
  the committed `judge-determinism-check-qwen38-mtp.json` already
  references.

### Added (2026-08-29 — multi-provider installer: Gemini CLI, generic MCP agents, capability matrix)
- **The installers wire any of four providers, together or alone.**
  `--client` / `-Client` now takes a comma- or space-separated list of
  `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `generic` (aliases `both` = claude,codex and
  `all` = claude,codex,gemini keep every documented invocation working), with
  an interactive multi-select when unset. Gemini CLI is first-class —
  `gemini mcp add -s user` shim or `-t http` fallback, standing block offered
  into `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` (Gemini has no hook system; flags verified live
  against gemini CLI 0.57.0) — and `generic` prints paste-ready `mcpServers`
  config (stdio + HTTP) for Cursor/Windsurf/Zed/Copilot-class agents plus a
  consent-gated `AGENTS.md` append (`--agents-file <path>`
  non-interactively). Preflight takes the same list grammar, probes the
  gemini CLI, and now checks pipx on Windows too.
- **Per-provider writer ids ride each shim registration** (`--env` /`-e`
  `PSEUDOLIFE_WRITER_ID=claude-code|codex|gemini`, forwarded by the shim as
  `X-PL-Writer`), so a shared bank attributes writes per agent. Env-flag
  support is probed per CLI with a flagless fallback plus printed manual
  config — a missing flag never fails the install. The daemon-side default
  in `ops/.env` stays the single selected provider's id, or `mcp-client`
  for multi-provider/generic installs (the old `both` rule).
- **A capability matrix and a per-agent wiring ladder.** Interactive runs
  show what each provider gets (MCP transport, session briefing, per-turn
  discipline, standing file) before wiring, and every run ends with a
  per-agent `[x]`/`[-]`/`[!]` ladder including remediation one-liners.
  Both blocks (and the new ASCII banner) are duplicated across
  `ops/install.sh`/`ops/install.ps1` and pinned byte-identical by
  marker-block sync guards in `tests/test_client_install_ux.py`.
  New guide page: `docs/guide/providers.md` (matrix, the hook-equivalent
  ladder, the AGENTS.md standard and the `@AGENTS.md` import bridge for
  Claude Code, Codex `[features] codex_hooks = true` opt-in + no-Windows
  limitation, writer ids).

### Changed (2026-08-29 — installer UX: banner, colored steps, `--instructions auto`)
- **The installers open with an ASCII banner and colored step lines** —
  interactive TTY only, suppressed by `NO_COLOR`, `TERM=dumb`, or
  `--no-art`/`-NoArt`; escapes are runtime-generated so no raw control
  bytes enter the tree. Step lines keep the literal `==>` prefix, and
  `install.sh --help` now prints the whole header via markers instead of a
  fixed line range (which silently truncated as the header grew).
- **`--instructions` default is now `auto`** (was: skip with a hint):
  unchanged for providers whose session-start briefing already delivers the
  block (Claude hook/plugin, Codex off-Windows), and an interactive
  consent prompt to append the standing block where none exists (Gemini,
  generic, Codex on Windows — there the standing file *is* the briefing).
  `auto` never writes a standing file in a non-interactive run (an explicit
  `--agents-file` or `--instructions append` is consent and still works);
  `--instructions append`/`skip` and the `--claude-md` alias behave exactly
  as before. `install.ps1` now also skips the Codex hook install on Windows
  (Codex hooks don't run there) instead of writing a hook that can never
  fire, and `ops/install-hook.*` explain the experimental
  `[features] codex_hooks = true` opt-in beside the existing trust-review
  warning.

### Fixed (2026-08-29 — the shim's spawn fallback can no longer shadow a Docker bank)
- **Hardened `shim.ensure_daemon` against the 2026-08-29 port-shadowing
  incident.** After a Windows reboot, Docker Desktop was still booting when
  the session's shim probed the daemon port, so the shim spawned a host-side
  fallback daemon; its bind beat Docker's port proxy (whose publish then
  failed silently — `HostConfig.PortBindings` declared,
  `NetworkSettings.Ports` empty), and the fallback served a retired 384-d
  file bank in place of the real Docker bank. Three defenses, one per
  confirmed failure mode:
  - **`PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_NO_SPAWN=1`** (new env var) disables the shim's
    spawn fallback: it waits up to ~3 min for the external daemon instead,
    then exits with the Docker recovery command. The Docker-tier installers
    (`ops/install.ps1` / `ops/install.sh`) now set it on every shim
    registration (both clients; for `claude mcp add` the `--env` must
    follow the server name — the option is variadic and placed earlier it
    swallows the name, verified live), and warn — with the exact upgrade
    commands — when an already-registered shim lacks the marker, since the
    add path is skipped for existing installs. Pip/lite installs keep the
    spawn fallback. (The multi-provider installer above extends the guard
    beyond the two original clients: Gemini CLI registrations and the
    generic `mcpServers` snippet carry it too, and the probed flagless
    fallbacks print it in their manual config edits.)
  - **`probe_health` now reads HTTP-error bodies** (`/health` serves
    degraded payloads as 503, which `urlopen` raises on): a reachable but
    degraded daemon is no longer mistaken for an absent one. A payload
    carrying `init_refusal` makes the shim print the daemon's own
    diagnosis and exit instead of spawning a doomed second daemon over the
    held port; other degraded states attach as before with one honest
    status line.
  - **A cross-process spawn lock** (per-user temp file keyed on the daemon
    URL) makes concurrent shims spawn at most one daemon — in the incident,
    two shims racing at 13:39 each spawned one (venv + global env). The
    loser waits for the winner's daemon; the lock is best-effort (a broken
    lock file degrades to the old behavior, never bricks a session) and OS
    locks die with their holder, so no stale-lock state exists.
  - **A file-mode hydration guard** in `MemoryService._ensure_init`: a bank
    whose hydrated entry/cortex embeddings don't match the live embedder's
    dimension now refuses at boot with a diagnosis naming the bank path,
    both dimensions, and the migration remedies — surfacing at `/health` as
    `degraded` like the schema-level Postgres refusal — instead of crashing
    every search/store with a bare torch shape error
    (`size mismatch, mat (12x384), vec (1024)`). Postgres banks were
    already guarded by `ensure_schema`'s `vector(N)` refusal; the v0.1 file
    mode hydrated `.pt` state unchecked.

### Changed (2026-08-28 — CI shards the full-suite lanes across two workers)
- **Both full-suite CI lanes run `pytest -n 2 --dist loadfile`**
  (pytest-xdist joins the dev extras). `--dist loadfile` keeps whole files
  on one worker so module-scoped fixtures keep their semantics; isolation
  is the per-process database naming that already guards concurrent local
  runs, extended to cover workers: an explicit
  `PSEUDOLIFE_TEST_DATABASE_URL` override now gets a per-worker suffix
  (a verbatim override shared by N workers would put every worker's
  backend reaper on one database), and the bench-DB autopin re-pins per
  worker instead of letting workers inherit the controller's pin (same
  reaper crossfire via `reset_bench()`). Both contracts are pinned in
  `tests/test_pg_run_isolation.py`; a deliberate operator-set
  `PSEUDOLIFE_BENCH_DB` still wins verbatim. Verified locally: full suite
  green at `-n 2` and `-n 4`, and under a CI-shaped override URL.

### Added (2026-08-28 — `CortexStore.clear()`, so test fixtures can reset the cortex)
- **`CortexStore.clear()`** — a test-support reset that empties the store in
  memory: `records`, both slot indexes (`_current`, `_members`, rebuilt via
  `_reindex_current`), the supersession log, the dirty-slot set, and
  `dream_cursor`. The construction knobs (`supersede_confidence_margin`,
  `reinforce_rate`, `protect_provenance`) are configuration, not state, and
  survive. It exists because `tests/conftest.py`'s `pristine_service` cleared
  the CMS and reference banks but not the cortex, so facts leaked between
  tests sharing a module-scoped service and files compensated by hand-rolling
  `cortex_forget` cleanup. No production behavior changes: nothing outside the
  fixtures calls it. Deliberately in-memory only — it drops `dirty_slots`
  rather than filling it, so a later `sync_cortex_slots` deletes nothing and a
  PG-backed bank's rows survive; durable deletion remains `forget()`.

### Changed (2026-08-28 — the deploy scripts' health wait is a parameter, not a constant)
- **`ops/update.ps1` and `ops/update.sh` no longer hard-code the step-4
  health wait.** The ps1 takes `-HealthRetries` / `-HealthDelayMs`; the sh
  port reads `HEALTH_RETRIES` / `HEALTH_DELAY_MS` from the environment.
  Defaults are unchanged (30 attempts, 1500ms apart, so ~45s before a deploy
  is declared unhealthy) and a run that passes nothing behaves exactly as
  before — there is no reason to lower them on a real deploy. The knob
  exists so the tests that drive the UNHEALTHY branch can exhaust the retry
  loop without spending the production budget: those three scenarios were
  137s of the test suite (~46s each) and are now under 2s in total, with
  the unhealthy-path contract (retries exhausted → honest rollback message,
  build-cache retention never reached, exit 1) unchanged and re-verified
  against a watched RED.

### Fixed (2026-08-28 — a too-old MCP SDK fails with the fix, not a traceback)
- **A shim launched from an environment whose MCP SDK predates v2 now exits
  with the exact recovery command instead of a raw `ModuleNotFoundError`.**
  The shim's registered command can live outside the repo venv — an editable
  install runs the working copy's current code against whatever SDK that
  environment has — so the v2 migration's `mcp>=2.1` floor (PR #198) silently
  broke such registrations: the import crash surfaced only as
  "Connection closed" in the MCP client log, and every affected session
  started without memory tools (seen live 2026-08-25 → 2026-08-28, global
  Python env on mcp 1.28.1). `run_shim` now probes for the v2 module the
  proxy actually imports before touching the daemon, and on failure prints
  the interpreter path and the `pip install -U "mcp>=2.1,<3"` command that
  fixes it.
- **The session briefing now explains tier-driven tool-removal notices, so
  sessions stop reporting the memory MCP as "offline" when it is healthy.**
  A session resumed from an older transcript can carry a larger tool roster
  than the daemon's current toolset tier serves; the harness then announces
  the difference as removed `mcp__pseudolife-memory__*` tools, and a live
  session (2026-08-28) relayed that to the user as the memory MCP being
  offline while every core tool worked. The briefing
  (`session_hook.MEMORY_LOOP_BLOCK` and its pinned twin
  `examples/CLAUDE.memory.md`) now says a removal notice means tier
  filtering, not an outage, and to make one `memory_search` call before
  reporting memory as offline.

### Changed (2026-08-28 — recall-before-review is codified in the hooks)
- **The served memory-loop instructions now carry an explicit
  recall-before-review trigger**: before reviewing code, docs, or a PR,
  search the bank first (`memory_search` + `memory_lesson_search`), then
  compare what memory says against the files and correct drift in both
  directions — stale memory gets fixed on the spot, and a memory-vs-file
  mismatch is review input, not noise. Served by the daemon
  (`/api/hook/session-start`), so existing installs pick the rule up on
  daemon update; mirrored in `examples/CLAUDE.memory.md` (guard-tested).
- **The plugin and `ops/install-hook.*` (Claude client) now install a
  `UserPromptSubmit` hook** echoing a one-line mid-session memory
  discipline on every turn, recall-before-review included. The one-shot
  session-start briefing loses salience over a long session (2026-08-25
  finding); a per-turn line keeps the loop mechanical for every install,
  not just primed maintainers. Static echo — no daemon call, fail-open,
  works offline. Codex is deliberately excluded: its per-prompt hook
  support is unverified, and every new Codex hook needs a manual trust
  review (2026-08-28).

### Security (2026-08-28 — workflows drop the default-writable GITHUB_TOKEN)
- **Explicit least-privilege `permissions` on both GitHub Actions
  workflows**, resolving the four open CodeQL
  `actions/missing-workflow-permissions` alerts: `ci.yml` gets a
  workflow-level `contents: read` (all three test lanes only check out and
  run tests), and `release.yml`'s `build` job gets `contents: read` to
  match its siblings, which already declared their own write scopes
  (`publish`/`registry`: `id-token`, `images`: `packages`). Previously
  these jobs ran with the repository's default token, which can write
  repo contents.

### Fixed (2026-08-28 — Codex hook trust is an explicit install step)
- **Codex now requires every new or changed lifecycle hook to be reviewed and
  trusted before it runs, but the hook installers reported success without
  mentioning that gate.** Both installer variants and the README now tell the
  user to approve the exact `~/.codex/hooks.json` definition on the next Codex
  start, and accurately explain that the richer session briefing is skipped
  until then (MCP tools and server `instructions` remain available).
- **The Codex HTTP example no longer inherits Claude's JSON-only `headers`
  advice.** Its TOML now uses Codex's supported `bearer_token_env_var` setting,
  keeping `PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_TOKEN` out of `config.toml` while allowing a
  token-protected daemon to connect.

### Security (2026-08-27 — Dependabot triage: three chromadb server CVEs, all unreachable, no patched release)
- Triaged the three open Dependabot alerts on `ops/requirements.lock.txt`,
  all against chromadb ≤ 1.5.9 with **no patched release** (1.5.9 is still
  the latest on PyPI, so no bump is possible): **CVE-2026-45833** (critical,
  authenticated RCE via `trust_remote_code` on the collection-update
  endpoint), **CVE-2026-45830** (high, any authenticated user can
  read/write any tenant's collections), **CVE-2026-45831** (high,
  `SimpleRBACAuthorizationProvider` never checks which tenant/database/
  collection a permission applies to). All three live in the Chroma HTTP
  server and its auth layer; the daemon's only chromadb use is the embedded
  `chromadb.PersistentClient` in `pseudolife_memory/memory/reference_bank.py`
  — no `HttpClient`, no Chroma server, no auth providers anywhere in the
  tree — so the vulnerable paths do not exist at runtime. Dismissed as
  *vulnerable code not used*, reasoning carried in the lockfile header
  alongside the 2026-07-16 CVE-2026-45829 note (same server-side class);
  re-check on the next chromadb release.

### Changed (2026-08-27 — the digest length target states what the model writes)
- **`memory.dream.digest_target_chars` default raised from `800` to
  `1200`.** The 2026-08-27 sidecar quality probe (three runs, nine
  digests, `evals/results/digest-sidecar-probe-sidecar-0827-c{1,2,3}.json`)
  showed the extractor steadily writing 1019–1908 chars (mean ~1435)
  against the 800 target, with the overrun carrying retrievable
  specifics — version pins, deadline changes, exact error names — rather
  than padding. No enforcement machinery added: the target is honest
  now instead of aspirational. `summarize_session`'s signature default
  moves in lockstep.

### Added (2026-08-27 — session-digest knobs reach the Console)
- **The session-digest feature (PR #202) shipped config-only: its knobs were
  never added to the Console registry, so the only way to enable digests on
  a live daemon was hand-editing `/data/config.yaml` inside the container.**
  The Dream group now surfaces `memory.dream.digest_enabled` (default stays
  off — enablement still gates on human review of the sidecar quality
  probe) plus the two tuning scalars an operator actually adjusts:
  `digest_target_chars` (prose length target) and `digest_context_chars`
  (per-call session-context cap, sized for the bundled CPU sidecar). All
  three are live knobs — the digest stage re-reads `service.config` every
  dream cycle, no restart needed. `digest_max_per_cycle` stays
  config.yaml-only (a backfill pacing constant, not an operator dial).

### Fixed (2026-08-27 — digest-stage hardening from the pre-PR review)
- **A failing digest write escaped `generate_digests_stage`, aborting the
  dream stages after it and re-paying the full map-reduce every dream
  while the failure persisted** (the 2026-07-06 dream-stall shape: a
  broken connection fails deterministically, and neither the cursor nor
  the retry ledger was touched). The write is now bounded like the
  malformed path — one held-cursor retry, then the cursor advances past
  the episode with a warning.
- **A pending session digest pinned the sweep trigger unconditionally,
  so during a backfill every 10-minute tick fired a dream that
  consolidated a partial batch (backlog 1, mid-session) and made zero
  digest progress** — digests run only on the empty-pull branch of the
  cycle, by design. `would_fire` now counts the digest backlog only when
  the pull would be empty; the normal `min_batch`/`idle_seconds` cadence
  drains entries first and the digest backlog fires the quiet ticks. The
  claims-branch dream result now carries the `digests` key too, so the
  result shape is stable for observers.

### Fixed (2026-08-27 — the sidecar probe timed out on full-size segments)
- **`evals/digest_sidecar_probe.py` built its extractor with the 240s
  constructor default instead of the resolved ops-contract timeout**
  (`PSEUDOLIFE_DREAM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` honoured, the same resolution the
  daemon uses — the Docker stack ships 480s for the E4B sidecar for this
  reason). The default E4B sidecar prompt-processes ~24 tok/s (measured
  2026-08-27), so every segment at the 24,000-char cap costs ~260s+ before
  generation and the probe recorded a timeout `ExtractorError` per session
  instead of a digest.

### Changed (2026-08-26 — the dream section moves out of service.py)
- **`service.py` had grown to 7.7k lines — a quarter of the package — with
  every dream-cycle feature since June accreting onto `MemoryService`.**
  Pure code motion, no behavior change: the dream consolidation cycle
  (pull/extract/commit and its stages — outcome inference, lesson
  synthesis, session digests), the deep-dream pass with its judge, and
  their dream-only private helpers (41 methods, ~2.4k lines) now live in
  `service_dream.py` as the `DreamOps` mixin that `MemoryService`
  inherits. Every method keeps its name, signature, and lock discipline;
  callers are unaffected. The lock-discipline guard
  (`tests/test_service_lock_discipline.py`) now scans both files and
  merges their call graphs before the fixpoint — red-checked against a
  doctored mixin to prove the extended scan is load-bearing. Moved code
  logs under `pseudolife_memory.service_dream` (was `.service`).

### Added (2026-08-26 — reranker training sees facts, and the audit nominates graduation candidates; schema v34)
- **The learned-reranker training log recorded only half of every search
  response: served entries, never the cortex facts served above them —
  and nothing turned the new read telemetry into an actionable list.**
  Schema v34 (additive/idempotent) adds `retrieval_events.served_facts`:
  the `memory_search` handler attaches the cortex-first block's served
  slots (`entity_norm`/`attribute_norm`/rank/score/kind/contested) to
  the exact event row that search wrote, keyed by the event id
  `search(return_event_id=True)` returns (opt-in, popped before the tool
  result — never part of the public search shape). `NULL` = pre-v34 row
  or no facts served; `retrieval_events_window()` exports the column for
  the Phase-1 trainer. Separately (no DDL), `read_audit` gains
  `graduation_candidates`: entries served in ≥60% of the last 30 days'
  distinct sessions (gated until ≥8 sessions are on record) — static
  context being re-paid for per query, i.e. "promote to CLAUDE.md"
  candidates, the follow-up PR #200 deferred.

### Added (2026-08-26 — read telemetry: slot reads, the explicit-reinforce split, and a `read_audit` stats section; schema v33)
- **A memory bank could not answer "which of my facts are ever actually
  read?" — entries carried `access_count`, but the cortex's fact slots had
  no read signal at all, and the `reinforcements` counter conflated the
  deliberate "this was useful" signal with the dream's automatic trace
  links.** Schema v33 (additive/idempotent) adds `slot_reads` — one
  counter row per `(entity_norm, attribute_norm)` slot, bumped when a
  fact is *served as an answer* (`memory_fact_get` and `memory_search`'s
  cortex-first block; slot-keyed like `memory_traces`, so cortex
  snapshot saves don't reset it). Deliberately uncounted: internal
  verification lookups (the dream rollback's post-revert check) and the
  facts attached to `memory_recall`/`memory_graph` neighborhoods, which
  are context rather than a direct answer — so a slot's never-read
  status is a lower bound, not proof it is unused — and
  `entries.explicit_reinforcements`, bumped only by `memory_reinforce`
  (the shared `reinforcements` counter is unchanged and still feeds the
  retention formula). `memory_stats` gains a `read_audit` section:
  never-read counts and fractions (overall, by age bucket, worst
  sources), total/median reads and top-decile read share, slot coverage,
  the explicit-vs-total reinforcement split, and a write-error counter
  (a silently-dead telemetry write must not read as "no fact is ever
  used"). Motivated by the 2026-08-26 live-bank audit
  (`evals/results/read-audit-20260826.json`: 12.7% of entries never
  surfaced, vs the 58% never-read Theo/t3.gg measured for Claude Code's
  built-in auto-memory in youtube.com/watch?v=Jf54k7tFeEc — different
  instrument, directionally comparable only). Kill-switch:
  `memory.cortex.read_tracking` (default on; one small upsert per
  fact-serving call, PG-only).

### Changed (2026-08-25 — MCP SDK v2 / protocol 2026-07-28: stateless core, per-request identity)
- **The daemon, shim, and toolset tiering now run on MCP Python SDK v2
  (`mcp>=2.1,<3`), serving protocol revision 2026-07-28 alongside every
  earlier revision from the same server — Claude Code negotiates the new
  stateless protocol; Claude Desktop and other handshake-era clients are
  unaffected.** What moved: `FastMCP` → `MCPServer`; transport-security
  settings now ride `build_streamable_http_app()` (v2 takes them at app
  build, not construction); the tiering transport hook collapsed from
  three v1 private-internals patches to one wrap of the v2 dispatch
  registry, which also binds each request's headers into the
  `writer_context` seam (v2 removed the ambient `request_ctx` the identity
  resolution rode on — no per-tool signature changes needed); the shim
  moved to `streamable_http_client` + an `httpx2` client carrying the
  `X-PL-Writer`/`X-PL-Session` headers, and its v1 content/validation
  juggling is gone — v2 constructor handlers pass `CallToolResult` through
  verbatim. Verified retained: the stringified-JSON parameter rescue
  (Claude clients' `tags='["…"]'` quirk) and `tools.listChanged` (modern
  clients derive it from `subscriptions/listen`; legacy clients keep the
  forced initialization option). Behavior note: `memory_toolset`'s
  `list_changed_sent` now reports "published" (subscription bus) rather
  than "a live session received it". Lockfile adds `httpx2`/`httpcore2`/
  `mcp-types`/`truststore`. No schema change (meta stays v32).

### Changed (2026-08-25 — session identity: episode handle becomes the primary anchor; transport fallback retired)
- **Concurrent Claude Code sessions share one streamable-HTTP connection,
  so the transport's `mcp-session-id` header identifies the connection,
  not the session — sub-episodes and lifecycle calls could land on a
  different session's episode tree (diagnosed 2026-07-18).**
  `memory_episode_start` and `memory_episode_end` now take an optional
  `episode` parameter (the session handle the session-start briefing
  already advertises): `episode_start` nests under that handle's session
  root, and `episode_end` pops strictly within the handle's subtree —
  never the session root itself, which stays owned by the hook lifecycle
  (SessionEnd / idle reaper). An unknown or closed handle degrades to the
  previous behavior and adds `episode_warning`, mirroring `memory_store`.
  The `mcp-session-id` fallback (identity tier 4) is retired — the MCP
  2026-07-28 revision (SEP-2567) removes the header from the protocol
  entirely; `PSEUDOLIFE_LEGACY_TRANSPORT_SESSION=1` restores it for one
  release as a rollback hatch and logs a warning on first use (explicit
  truthy values only — `0`/`false` mean off). Review hardening
  (2026-08-25 eight-angle pass): `episode_end` resolves without the
  resume side effect, so a late end on a reaped session refuses instead
  of resurrecting the root; the handle-anchored nest/pop pins to the
  handle's own subtree even when two open roots share a session key
  (`Episodes.end_episode` closes exactly the found leaf); an empty-string
  handle (a known client quirk for optional params) degrades like "no
  handle"; keyless roots are rejected inside the resolver so every handle
  consumer shares one contract; `memory_session_title` also takes
  `episode=` (the only identity a hook-registered direct-HTTP client has
  now); and the session-start briefing tells agents to pass the handle on
  the lifecycle tools, not just writes. Design:
  `docs/specs/2026-08-25-mcp-v2-session-identity-design.md`.
### Fixed (2026-08-25 — re-mint repairs the fact/lesson cross-index)
- **A freshly minted entity re-links the orphaned fact and lesson rows of
  its name.** `delete_entity` NULLs `facts`/`lessons` `entity_id` and
  `object_entity_id` (no cascade), and nothing in the live daemon re-linked
  those rows until their slot was next written — so a deleted-then-re-minted
  name under-counted everywhere the FK is read: fold-direction ranking,
  `backfill_entity_sources` (entity→project attribution), and
  `lesson_entity_ids` (the lesson-only junk protection). This is the general
  repair deferred from #177, whose guard-side workaround (counting current
  facts by subject name) stands independently. The repair matches
  conservatively — candidates by `norm_name(raw stored text) == canonical`,
  the same rule slot-write linking applies (minus aliases, which a fresh
  mint cannot have), updated by exact stored text;
  the cortex-normed `entity_norm` column is never consulted (the two norm
  spaces disagree, e.g. `"G:"` → `"g"` vs `"g:"`). Mint-only by an
  `xmax = 0` insert check, so the repeated-upsert hot path (every
  `memory_outcome` log) pays nothing; orphans whose entity already exists
  still re-link on their next slot write, as before. `entity_sources`
  attribution heals on the next backfill pass once the FK is restored.
  Tombstone removal/expiry for `merge_decisions` remains deferred (third
  deliberate deferral): those rows are the durable merge audit, so a removal
  path should be a status flip with its own review surface, not a row
  delete riding along here.
### Changed (2026-08-25 — benchmark docs re-framed on the full 500-question run; the 0.936 headline retired)
- **The README led with a number the current bench instrument does not
  reproduce, drawn from the most favourable 78 of 500 questions (#188).**
  Both halves are fixed at their sites. **(1) Retired: cascade 0.936 on
  LongMemEval knowledge-update.** It was measured on the 2026-07-30 stack
  (Qwen3.6-27B answerer and judge). Re-running the
  same 78 questions after the 2026-08-17 migration to Qwen3.8-27B
  (`ceiling-v38`, n=3, std 0.0000, like `ceiling-e2e` before it) gives
  **cascade 0.936 → 0.846** against a naive-RAG control that is **0.859 on
  both stacks** — the published posture now sits *below* its own control.
  Root cause, recomputed from the committed per-question rows: the cascade
  routes on whether the cortex arm abstains, so its input is the answerer's
  abstention behaviour, not a property of the memory — **32/78 abstentions
  at 46/46 commit precision** on the old stack versus **22/78 at 0.839** on
  the new one, so nine wrong answers are served where a RAG fallback used to
  rescue them. The two runs' fact contexts are not byte-identical and the
  migration moved extractor, answerer and judge together, so the artifacts
  do not isolate which term did it — which is the finding, not a caveat: the
  claim was never measured for instrument transfer. The number stays visible
  with strikethrough and this explanation at every site that published it
  (README front door and Benchmarks section, `docs/guide/benchmarks.md`,
  `evals/README.md`), per the retire-at-the-old-site rule.
  **(2) The front door now leads with the full six-type run**
  (`longmemeval-all-oracle-qwen-27b-alltypes-0803`, 500 questions, single
  pass, Qwen3.6 judge), with the knowledge-update slice as a named sub-row:
  overall **rag 0.688 / cortex 0.416 / hybrid 0.664 / cascade 0.690** at
  **~1210 / ~158 / ~842 / ~883** context tokens per question — equal
  accuracy to naive RAG at ~73% of the context, i.e. a wash (one question in
  500), not the ~8-point win the KU slice alone suggested. The per-type
  breakdown ships with it and states the losses plainly (multi-session 0.474
  vs 0.504, single-session-preference 0.700 vs 0.800, temporal-reasoning a
  tie). The one claim that survives a judge swap unchanged is the abstention
  edge: BEAM-100K abstention **cortex 0.950 vs rag 0.775**, identical under
  the local Qwen3.8 judge and an independent Opus-class re-judge.
- **The full-haystack teaser row left the README front door** (cascade 0.462
  vs rag 0.346, p = 0.011). It is a 2026-07-30 measurement on the retired
  judge, its extraction predates the earliest committed op-prompt artifact
  (`v5`, 2026-08-01; the shipped pin is now `v10`), and it has never
  been re-judged, while the same metric lost 0.090 on the oracle slice when
  the stack migrated. It survives in `docs/guide/benchmarks.md` under a
  dated currency note as an engineering-log result.
- **BEAM is documented in `evals/README.md` for the first time** — what the
  benchmark is (ten memory abilities, 100K–10M-token procedurally generated
  chats, rubric-item judging), how to run the adapter/re-judge/reader-sweep,
  and a findings table over the committed artifacts from PRs #191–#192:
  budget-matched hybrid is a wash rather than a loss (rag 0.6425 vs hybrid
  0.6226 at 16/16, −0.020 ± 0.029), BEAM judge transfer is small and
  measured (≤0.016 per arm against a 0.073 stability floor), most of the gap
  to published leaderboard numbers is context volume in the reading stack
  (6→48 turns is +0.186 ± 0.041; a frontier reader over identical contexts
  adds only ~0.04), and three weaknesses survive any reading stack
  (summarization, event ordering, and abstention degrading with volume).
  An undocumented benchmark with committed artifacts was a gap in the same
  evidence discipline the rest of the tree enforces.
- **Two standing rules added to `CLAUDE.md`** under "Publishing a benchmark
  number": a bench-instrument migration (judge or answerer) blocks the
  release gate until the docs-currency pass lands, and a claim is only
  promoted to the README after the headline slice runs under two independent
  judge families. The 0.936 run replicated at std 0.0000 three times —
  determinism was read as validity, and judge transfer was never measured.
- **`tests/test_eval_evidence.py`** gains rows for every number added or
  moved: the 500-question table and its per-type breakdown, the
  `ceiling-v38` side-by-side, the abstention/commit-precision counts
  (computed from the committed per-question JSONL rows), the BEAM findings,
  and retired-marker rows that keep the struck 0.936 pinned to the artifact
  that produced it.
### Added (2026-08-25 — adoption surfaces: install front door, comparison, security posture, support) [#189]
- **The README now leads with the two-command lite path instead of a git
  clone and a multi-GB image.** The first screen is `pip install
  "pseudolife-mcp[lite]"` plus one client-registration command (Claude
  Code or Codex), the try-it line, and an honest lite-vs-durable
  inventory; the Docker stack is demoted to a clearly-labelled durable
  tier below it. Nothing was deleted — the WSL2 memory guidance moved to
  a new **Configuration → Windows / WSL2 memory** section, the two
  manual-migration blockquotes (schema v25 re-embed, PostgreSQL 16→18
  cutover) collapsed to pointers at their existing runbooks, and the
  Windows ASCII-data-path caveat moved from the quickstart into
  Troubleshooting. Rationale: every competitor's fastest credible path is
  under two minutes with no container runtime, and ours already was — it
  just sat ~100 lines down under a hedged heading.
- **The lite tier's missing extractor is now stated where a user meets
  it, not only in a log line nobody reads.** Lite ships no **extractor**,
  so the **dream** pass advances its **cursor** but writes no canonical
  facts and `memory_fact_set` is the only **cortex** writer — previously
  indistinguishable from a broken cortex. `/health` gains an additive
  `extractor` field (`none` / `configured` / `disabled`; omitted when the
  service carries no resolvable dream config, and deliberately *not*
  reflected in `status`, since `web/api.py` serves any non-ok payload as
  a 503 that the Docker healthcheck and `ops/update.*` treat as fatal).
  The stdio shim prints what is and is not working, plus the fix, once
  per session when the daemon it attached to reports `extractor: "none"` —
  the daemon's own startup warning is invisible on this path because
  `shim.spawn_daemon` discards its stderr. That warning now also names the
  fix command. Only an explicit `"none"` fires the notice: a configured
  extractor, a deliberately dream-disabled bank, and an older daemon whose
  `/health` predates the field all stay quiet.
- **`docs/guide/comparison.md`** — the first named-competitor comparison:
  Mem0, Zep/Graphiti, Letta, Cognee, memU and Memori, on the axes this
  project is built around (one current value per **slot**, **supersession**
  with version history, **provenance** tiers and **contender** parking,
  human-reviewed merges with audit-stamped decisions, staleness as a
  serving decision, zero-egress extraction, artifact-pinned numbers) — led
  by the honest baseline of a markdown file plus grep, and closing with a
  "use something else if" table that concedes multi-tenant SaaS, SSO and
  compliance, managed hosting, agent-framework runtime, and non-MCP
  clients by name. Every external claim is dated to the 2026-08 sweep it
  came from and phrased as an observation of that project's docs at that
  time, never as a present-tense absence; the page says so at the top and
  asks readers to check current docs. It states no benchmark numbers of
  its own, deferring to Benchmarks.
- **`docs/guide/security-posture.md`** — the memory-integrity half of the
  security story, framed against OWASP's persistent-memory-poisoning
  entry (ASI06, December 2025). Maps each shipped mechanism to the
  poisoning step it contains (provenance tiers, contender parking, the
  opt-in **consolidation quarantine** two-man rule, the human-gated
  **review queue** with `merge_decisions` audit rows, the v27 dream
  rollback journal, the engram cross-index, supersession history, writer
  keying, `source="status"` exclusion, the `stale_policy` *serving-side*
  quarantine) with each one's default, and states flatly what is **not**
  defended — prompt injection against the agent, content screening (the
  MAFIA evaded class, including this project's own literal-faithfulness
  gate), cryptographic writer authentication, ranking as a defense,
  volume anomaly detection, unverified world-fact citations, and the host
  itself. SECURITY.md keeps vulnerability reporting and gains a pointer.
- **Support surface for external users**: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
  issue forms (bug report asking for `/health` output, version + schema,
  install tier, client and transport, with a redact-secrets warning and a
  security-reports-go-elsewhere banner; feature request asking what you
  were trying to do), `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` routing security
  reports to private advisories, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
  carrying the repo's actual shipping checklist, a standard Contributor
  Covenant 2.1 `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and a README **Support** section
  stating solo-maintained and best-effort in as many words.

### Fixed (2026-08-25 — retrieval-log/compaction/dream-run retention never ran with dreaming disabled)
- **A bank with `memory.dream.enabled=false` (a documented, first-class
  knob) never pruned `retrieval_events`, superseded cortex/world/lesson
  rows, or the v27 dream-run journal — all three grew unbounded.**
  `start_dream_sweep()` only started the sweep thread when
  `dream.enabled` was true, so on a dream-disabled bank the thread that
  runs `run_sweep_once` (and therefore every retention call inside it)
  never existed at all; `run_sweep_once` itself then compounded this by
  returning `{"fired": false, "reason": "disabled"}` before reaching its
  own prune/compact block. The `run_sweep_once` code comment (not this
  CHANGELOG — the 2026-08-20 v31 entry below only says events "are pruned
  on the dream-sweep tick," which is accurate as far as it goes) claimed
  the retrieval-log retention "rides the same unconditional tick," true
  only of whether a *dream fires*, not of whether dreaming is *enabled*;
  the retrieval log has no other reaper and accrues on every
  `memory_search` regardless. `start_dream_sweep()` now starts whenever
  EITHER `dream.enabled` OR `memory.retrieval_log.enabled` is true (the
  latter defaults on and also now flags `restart: true` in the Console
  config panel, for the same reason), and
  `run_sweep_once` now runs compaction, dream-run-journal pruning, and
  retrieval-log pruning before the disabled check, not after — all three
  tables are fed by write paths (`memory_fact_set`/`memory_world_set`, a
  manual `memory_dream` run, and the end-of-session
  `dream_run_auto` fired by `_fire_and_forget_dream`) that never check
  `dream.enabled` in the first place, so a dream-disabled bank can still
  accumulate rows in all three without a periodic reaper. Hardening: the
  sweep-tick fake in `tests/test_dream.py` now also implements
  `prune_retrieval_log` (the real method name, not a stand-in), so a
  future rename that silently broke the `getattr`-guarded call would fail
  a test instead of quietly disabling retention again.
### Security (2026-08-25 — stored XSS in the galaxy view's node tooltip)
- **Graph entity names reached the 3D galaxy view's tooltip via innerHTML
  (#171).** `galaxy.js` handed the vendored `3d-force-graph` bundle each
  entity's raw name as a plain STRING via `.nodeLabel((n) => n.id)`; the
  bundle's tooltip module renders string content with `.html(content)`, so
  a hostile entity name (e.g. an `<img onerror=...>` payload, plausible via
  a prompt-injected ingested document reaching the extractor — write-time
  `junk_name_reason()` screens junk shapes, not markup) executed on hover.
  On the shipped tokenless default, same-origin JS reaches `/api`
  unauthenticated, so the payload could drive every mutation route.
  `nodeLabel` now returns a DOM node (`el("span", {}, n.id)`, text set via
  `document.createTextNode`) instead of a string — verified against the
  vendored bundle's tooltip `update()`: an `HTMLElement` content value takes
  the safe `.append(() => content)` branch (d3 inserts the live node as-is,
  never through `.html()`), while a string still takes the vulnerable
  branch. No other label/tooltip path in `galaxy.js` (`linkLabel`, etc.)
  sets a string accessor. A markup-shaped entity stays in the Console dev
  server's demo graph fixture so the fix is eyeball-checkable live.
### Fixed (2026-08-25 — System Atlas currency: migration list, extractor size, removed tool)
- **`docs/atlas/atlas.json` had drifted on three points** (#184): the
  `storage/schema.py` card's migration list stopped at v29 even though
  `SCHEMA_META_VERSION` had moved to 31 — v30 (merge-proposal judge
  verdict) and v31 (retrieval event log) were missing; the installer card
  still quoted the retired ~9 GB `sonnet-only` savings figure instead of
  the current ~11.8 GB; and the CMS card still named the removed
  `memory_trace` tool instead of `memory_search(explain=True)`, which it
  was folded into. `meta.verified` restamped 2026-08-25.
- **`tests/test_atlas_currency.py` gained three guards** so these rot
  classes fail CI instead of drifting quietly: the migration list is
  pinned against `SCHEMA_META_VERSION` (every version from the list's
  start through current must appear), the extractor-size figure is pinned
  against README.md's authoritative `~N GB lighter` figure, and a
  removed-tool-name list (starting with `memory_trace`) is checked
  word-boundary-matched against the whole atlas so it can't false-positive
  on the still-live `memory_traces` table. All three watched RED against
  the pre-fix atlas.json before the fix landed.
### Fixed (2026-08-25 — install.sh no longer aborts mid-install on PEP 668 distros, #176)
- **A failed shim install now falls back to the HTTP transport instead of
  killing the installer.** On PEP 668 distros (Ubuntu 24.04+, Debian 12+,
  Fedora 40, Arch) with no pipx, `pip install --user` exits 1 with
  `externally-managed-environment`; under `set -e` that aborted
  `ops/install.sh` at step 10 — after the multi-GB image build — with a raw
  pip traceback, no MCP transport registered, and the `--transport http`
  hint unreachable. `ensure_shim` now exit-checks every pipx/pip invocation
  (as `ops/install.ps1` always has), so failure leaves the shim flag unset
  and the existing per-client HTTP fallback plus remediation text fire.
  `ops/preflight.sh` gains a pipx check that warns about the PEP 668
  fallback before anything is built. Guard test pins all four exit-checked
  install paths.
### Fixed (2026-08-25 — a junk tombstone can no longer delete a re-minted real entity)
- **The deep dream's tombstone auto-delete now applies the fact-count half
  of the evidence bar too** (#177). A junk verdict on a short name plants a
  permanent tombstone — nothing removes a `merge_decisions` row — and the
  tombstone branch consulted degree only, so months later the same name
  standing for a real entity with a dozen cortex facts and one edge was
  deleted unattended on `deep_dream(apply=true)`, taking its edges, aliases,
  sources and the fact-to-entity cross-index with it (the fact rows survive
  on entity text, the node re-mints on next mention, and the cycle repeats).
  A tombstone now relaxes the **degree** bar only: an entity with more than
  one current fact stays put and sits in the review queue as an ordinary junk
  proposal for a human verdict. That fact count is taken by subject **name**
  as well as by `facts.entity_id`, because `delete_entity` NULLs the FK on
  every fact of the deleted node and nothing re-links it — so on banks where
  a name was already wrongly deleted, its surviving facts are orphaned and
  the id-keyed count alone would still read the re-mint as contentless and
  delete it again. Zero-structure auto-delete of never-judged names is
  otherwise unchanged. Supersedes the 2026-08-16 tombstone entry below.
### Fixed (2026-08-25 — release-integrity audit: stale `__version__` + late server.json guard)
- **`pseudolife_memory.__version__` no longer drifts from `pyproject.toml`
  (issue #180).** It was a hand-maintained literal stuck at `0.6.0` against
  `pyproject.toml`'s `0.14.0` — eight releases of drift, nothing pinned it.
  It now derives from the installed distribution's metadata via
  `importlib.metadata.version("pseudolife-mcp")`, falling back to a
  `0.0.0+unknown` sentinel only when no metadata is installed at all. Every
  build backend stamps dist-info from `pyproject.toml` at build time, so
  this is correct for anything actually shipped. Guarded by
  `tests/test_plugin_packaging.py::test_package_version_matches_pyproject`
  (skips, with a stated reason, only when the local dev install's dist-info
  itself is stale — not a real release path).
- **The MCP registry's `server.json` version guard now runs before the PyPI
  publish, not after (issue #185).** It previously lived in the `registry`
  job of `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which only runs downstream of the
  irreversible `publish` job — a version-field mismatch failed only after
  the upload, burning a release number (PyPI never accepts a same-version
  re-upload). The guard moved into the `build` job, alongside the existing
  tag↔pyproject guard, so both fail before anything builds or uploads.
  Locally guarded too:
  `tests/test_plugin_packaging.py::test_server_json_versions_match_pyproject`
  pins both `server.json` version fields and the `ops/docker-compose.yml`
  daemon image tag (which the compose file already documented as the deploy
  source of truth, but nothing checked it) against `pyproject.toml`.
### Fixed (2026-08-25 — interrupted legacy import resumes instead of blocking)
- **A legacy `.pt` import that died part-way no longer permanently blocks
  the retry and silently drops the remainder (#187).** `migrate_legacy`
  commits per entry and renames the sources only at the very end, while its
  only idempotency guard was "the entries table is non-empty" — so a
  malformed row, embedder failure, dropped connection, full disk or killed
  machine durably committed some rows, and every later boot then answered
  `storage_not_empty`: the remaining entries and **all** cortex facts were
  never imported, the sources never got their `.pre-v8.bak` rename, and the
  service caller swallowed the exception to a single warning. Progress is
  now *recorded* rather than inferred, in a `legacy_migration` meta row
  (status, source fingerprint, entries-done count) — no schema change. A
  later boot with `status=in_progress` and a matching source fingerprint
  resumes the import, skipping rows already committed by identity
  (`text` + `timestamp` — the `entries.id` serial is minted at insert, and
  `band` is deliberately excluded because `hydrate_cms` rewrites it to the
  live preset on the same boot that imported the row), so nothing is
  duplicated. A resume MERGES the cortex rather than replacing it: only
  slots nobody has written yet take legacy rows, the dream cursor only
  moves forward, and the supersession log is seeded only when empty — the
  daemon keeps serving through the degraded window, so a snapshot rewrite
  would destroy whatever landed there. `status=done` is written only after
  the renames succeed, and a recorded source that vanished without being
  renamed refuses the resume instead of marking a short bank done. A
  populated bank
  with no progress record keeps the old refusal, so a legacy `.pt` can
  never be merged into somebody's live bank, and a *different* `.pt` bank
  dropped in over an interrupted one is refused on the fingerprint instead
  of being folded into its leftovers. Banks migrated before this change
  have no meta row but do have renamed sources, so they never enter the
  import path at all.
- **A partial import is now loud.** `MemoryService._ensure_init` still
  boots (a half-imported bank serves fine) but logs at ERROR naming the
  resume path and the meta row, and `/health` grows a `migration_partial`
  field — previously the only trace was one `WARNING` line. `status` stays
  `"ok"` deliberately: `web/api.py` serves any non-ok payload as HTTP 503,
  which the Docker healthcheck and the install/update scripts treat as
  fatal, so flagging it there would turn a non-fatal partial import into a
  bricked deploy loop. The module docstring's claim that
  this failure class was closed in 2026-07-28 is corrected: that fix
  removed the commonest *cause* (embedding-dimension mismatch), not the
  unrecoverability.
### Fixed (2026-08-25 — the MC scorer read the article "a" as answer A; #173)
- **`lme_v2_smoke.score_mc`'s no-box fallback is now anchored and
  uppercase-only, and every LongMemEval-V2 number it produced is
  corrected.** The fallback accepted any standalone `[A-Ha-h]` token and
  upper-cased it, so an answerer that ran out of tokens mid-reasoning —
  the dominant unboxed shape in every committed artifact — scored as
  answer **A** on the English article "a". Measured over
  `lme-v2-smoke-slice2.jsonl`: 57 of 105 MC arm-answers carry no box and
  the old fallback's matched token was the article "a" 40 times, against 4
  uppercase letters that were all option *enumerations* ("`*   A. Service
  Catalog`") rather than stated answers. A letter now counts only when it
  is the whole response or follows an explicit answer marker
  ("Answer:", "the answer is", "the correct option is"); a bare "Option X"
  is deliberately not a marker, because enumerations are the noise class
  itself. Not one unboxed response in any committed artifact states an
  answer, so the strict form loses nothing measurable. The boxed-answer
  path is untouched.
- **Corrections published beside the originals, which are left as the runs
  wrote them** (`evals/rescore_strict_mc.py`, offline, no GPU). All 25
  flips across the four artifacts run the same way — correct → wrong, 24
  of them on gold **A** via the article "a" and one on gold **E** via a
  quoted "option E says" mention. None went the other way, and no
  non-multiple-choice row moved at all.
  - Full 74-question `procedure` category
    (`lme-v2-smoke-slice2{,-compose}-rescored-strictmc.summary.json`),
    default prompt / compose prompt: rag 0.162 → **0.149** / 0.284 →
    **0.257**; cortex 0.068 → **0.068** / 0.216 → **0.176**; hybrid
    0.243 → **0.203** / 0.284 → **0.270**. The exact hybrid-vs-rag tie
    under the compose prompt was an artifact of the defect; corrected it
    is 0.270 vs 0.257, the same "no measurable difference".
  - Replicated 10-question pilot
    (`lme-v2-smoke-slice1-rescored-strictmc.agg.json`): KU hybrid
    0.533 → **0.500**; compose rag 0.500 → **0.433**, cortex 0.233 →
    **0.200**, hybrid 0.633 → **0.533**.
  - Qwen3.6-vs-3.8 paired verdict of 2026-08-19
    (`lme-v2-qwen38-vs-slice2-paired56-rescored-strictmc.json`): cortex
    +0.089 (6W/1L, p 0.125) → **+0.036** (3W/1L, p 0.625); rag +0.018
    (8W/7L) → **+0.018** (7W/6L); hybrid −0.018 (8W/9L) → **−0.036**
    (7W/9L). The judge arms are untouched by the scorer and reproduce the
    superseded artifact exactly, which is what licenses reading the
    eval-arm movement as the fix and nothing else.
- **A working-copy run is also affected, and deliberately gets no number
  here.** The audit that found this was run against a 74-row working copy
  of the 3.8 slice and its `paired74` comparison, neither of which is
  committed. Re-scoring them moves that comparison's cortex arm from
  significant to not significant — but publishing the figures would be a
  claim with no artifact a reader can check, which is the rule this repo
  wrote `tests/test_eval_evidence.py` to enforce. Whoever promotes those
  rows must re-score them with `evals/rescore_strict_mc.py` before
  quoting any number from them. *(Resolved 2026-08-30: those rows are now
  committed with exactly that re-score — see the Unreleased entry above —
  and the corrected comparison is not significant.)*

### Fixed (2026-08-25 — bench reset leaked FK-free tables between questions; #181)
- **The eval harness's bench reset now truncates every table in the
  schema, not the eleven someone remembered.** `TRUNCATE … CASCADE`
  reaches only tables with a foreign key into the truncated set, so
  `retrieval_events`, `entity_kinds`, `outcome_signals`,
  `dismissed_pairs`, `merge_decisions` and `communities` survived
  `ladder_sweep.reset_bench()` and carried rows from one bench question
  into the next. Leaked `entity_kinds` rows are the sharp end: they flip a
  later question's `freshness_class` (evergreen → volatile) and so change
  what the `stale_policy` serves — the same contamination class as the
  2026-08-04 `chronicle_events` incident, whose fix taught the lesson to
  exactly one of the two lists.
- **One list, defined beside the DDL:** `storage.schema.BENCH_RESET_TABLES`
  is now the single source of truth, consumed by
  `evals/ladder_sweep.py`, `tests/pg_fixtures.py` and `tests/test_graph.py`
  (which carried a third, nine-table inline copy). The test fixture's own
  list was missing `communities`; the shared list closes that too. A guard
  test parses every `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` out of `schema.py` and
  fails if any table is absent from the list, so the next schema bump
  cannot reopen the gap silently.
### Fixed (2026-08-25 — PG18 cutover dump: the same pipefail defect as #172, follow-up)
- **`ops/migrate-pg18.ps1` guarded its cutover dump with gzip's exit status,
  not pg_dump's.** The PG 16 → 18 migration script still carried the exact
  `pg_dump | gzip` shape fixed in `ops/backup.ps1|.sh` below: the container's
  POSIX `sh` has no `pipefail`, so a pg_dump that died partway would have
  passed the "cutover pg_dump failed" check. Blast radius was limited — the
  migration's exact table-count verification would catch a truncated dump
  before the daemon restarted, and the old PG 16 volume is retained as the
  rollback — which is why it was deferred out of the audit change rather
  than fixed inline. pg_dump now writes the gzip itself (`-Z9`, plain
  format; verified PG 18's pg_dump accepts a bare `-Z9`, and the output
  stays a normal single-member gzip so the `gunzip -c` restore step is
  unchanged), and the script joins the no-pipeline guard test
  (`tests/test_ops_backup_integrity.py::test_dump_is_not_piped_into_gzip`).
  It deliberately does NOT get the end-of-dump marker check — the count
  verification is its completion guard.

### Fixed (2026-08-25 — ops-script audit: three ways a backup or a rollback quietly wasn't one)
- **A pg_dump that died partway produced a "good" backup (#172).**
  `ops/backup.ps1|.sh` ran `pg_dump` piped into `gzip` inside the container;
  the container's POSIX `sh` has no `pipefail`, so the status `docker exec`
  returned was gzip's — a dump killed halfway still landed as a non-empty,
  valid gzip of a truncated dump, which passed the only other guard (a
  zero-length check; gzip of empty input is ~20 bytes). `update.ps1` then
  deployed believing it had a backup, and age-based rotation eventually
  deleted the last good one. pg_dump now writes the gzip itself (`-Z9`,
  plain format), so the status really is pg_dump's and no uncompressed
  scratch file is needed inside the container; the artifact is then read
  back on the HOST and must carry PostgreSQL's end-of-dump marker, which
  covers a truncated `docker cp` too. Artifacts land on a `.part` name and
  are promoted only after they verify, so a rejected dump can never sit in
  `data/backups` looking like the newest good backup (it is kept, not
  deleted — it is the evidence).
- **The restore rehearsal passed a backup that had lost every lesson,
  episode, entity and edge (#182).** `ops/restore.ps1|.sh` printed a
  live-vs-restored count table for seven tables but set its failure flag
  from `entries`/`facts` alone — the first and largest sections of a dump —
  so an artifact truncated after them rehearsed "PASSED" while everything
  behind them came back empty. The whole-table alarm (live > 0, restored
  == 0) now covers every counted table, and a restored count materially
  below live alarms too (partial truncation is the likelier outcome): below
  half, and only from 20 live rows up, since a dump is always older than
  the live bank and a ratio over single-digit counts is meaningless. A row
  count that could not be READ alarms as well, instead of silently
  switching the comparison off for that table. The young-bank false
  positive stays impossible — the live count still gates every check.
- **A real restore ignored whether its DROP/CREATE DATABASE worked (#182).**
  One leftover session blocks `DROP DATABASE`, and the failure surfaced two
  steps later as "restore failed mid-way" — against the OLD database.
  Straggler sessions on the target are now terminated deliberately
  (`pg_terminate_backend`, excluding this session), and both statements are
  status-checked with a message naming what actually happened and what state
  the bank is in.
- **Re-running `update.ps1` after a failed deploy destroyed the rollback
  image (#183).** The rollback tag was moved onto whatever the version tag
  pointed at, at the start of every run — but `docker compose up --build`
  builds first and the deploy is validated after, so a run that aborted in
  between left the version tag on a freshly built, never-validated image.
  The natural next move — re-run — then tagged THAT as the rollback (seen
  live 2026-08-13). Both scripts now resolve the RUNNING daemon container's
  image ID and refuse to move the tag when it disagrees with the version
  tag's, keeping the existing rollback and saying why; `-ForceRollbackTag` /
  `--force-rollback-tag` overrides. A stopped daemon cannot witness a
  mismatch and keeps the old behavior, and the happy path (IDs match) is
  unchanged.
### Changed (2026-08-25 — argument contracts moved into the tool schemas)
- **Every MCP tool now documents its arguments in the tool's own
  `inputSchema` instead of cramming them into the description string.**
  Nothing on the surface carried parameter descriptions before: an
  argument's range, units, format, or "this bounds the seed search, not
  the result" all had to live in the one description blob, which is the
  string the per-tier manifest budget meters. That budget had been bumped
  three times in six weeks (2026-07-18, 07-31, 08-05), each time after
  trimming descriptions "to the minimum", and it still stood at 14 chars
  of headroom on `minimal` and 20 on `core` — with the result that real
  behavioral contracts were competing for characters. The #186
  `memory_recall` fix landed the day before had lost its `hops` ceiling
  and its cap numbers to exactly that wall.
  Each argument's own contract now ships as an `Annotated[T,
  Field(description=...)]` on the tool signature, which FastMCP renders
  into `inputSchema.properties[arg].description`; the tool description
  keeps what the tool is for, the contracts that span several arguments,
  and the return shape. Tool-call behavior is unchanged — argument names,
  types, defaults, optionality, enum values, `outputSchema` and
  annotations are byte-identical across all 35 tools with descriptions
  stripped; `Field` carries a description and nothing else.
- **`memory_recall`'s full contract is documented again.** Its purpose and
  `low_confidence` fallback and the caps/per-hop-reservation return
  contract are back in the description, and the `hops` ceiling (clamped
  to 1..5) plus the `top_k` seed-bound-not-result-bound rule now sit on
  those two parameters. The description is smaller than the pre-trim
  original because the argument text moved to the schema.
- **The manifest budget now meters the schema too**, so the newly-used
  space is accounted rather than becoming an unmetered escape hatch:
  `tests/test_tool_consolidation.py::test_descriptions_fit_tier_budgets`
  raises the description budgets to 5,000 / 11,500 / 17,000 chars
  (minimal / core / full) and adds a per-tier cap on the sum of
  param-description chars (2,600 / 5,100 / 8,200, measured 1,826 / 4,304
  / 7,413 the day it landed) plus a 300-char cap per parameter beside the
  existing 1,600 per tool. Post-change descriptions measure 3,232 /
  7,289 / 11,941.
- `pydantic>=2.11,<3` is now a declared dependency — `mcp_server.py`
  imports `pydantic.Field` directly rather than relying on it arriving
  through `mcp`.

### Fixed (2026-08-25 — `memory_recall` no longer returns an unbounded payload, #186)
- **`memory_recall` now caps `entities`/`edges`/`texts`/per-entity `facts`
  and truncates supporting text — with a per-hop quota, not a flat
  prefix slice.** `top_k` only ever bounded the seed search; graph
  expansion fanned out from there with no bound of its own, and the
  compact projection `memory_search` applies to entry text
  (`_compact_entry`) was never applied on the recall path. Issue #186's
  live audit (2026-08-21, real daemon) measured one 3-hop query
  (`hops=3`, default `top_k=5`, `verbose=False`) at 93.7 KB total, enough
  that the calling client refused it; a separate pass over that same
  response reported 53 entities (38.6 KB), 75 edges (5.3 KB), and 45
  uncapped full entry texts (51.9 KB) — those three figures sum to
  95.8 KB, ~2% over the stated total, and are kept here exactly as
  audited (that live response can't be re-measured without the daemon
  and bank it ran against).
  A first cut of this fix (same day) shipped a flat `[:N]` slice per
  field, which review caught as wrong: `run_recall` appends seeds then
  each hop's discoveries in turn, so a flat prefix is a breadth-first
  window, not a relevance ranking — a hub seed's wide 1-hop ring could
  fill the entire edge cap by itself and silently drop every hop-2/hop-3
  bridge (the actual reason to call `memory_recall` over `memory_search`),
  and `texts[:cap]` was purely the flat seed search's own window (zero
  hop-discovered text survived once `top_k >= cap`). The shipped version
  instead reserves a minimum per-hop quota for `entities`/`edges`
  (`mcp_server._hop_quota_select`, favoring later hops on any leftover
  budget), prefers `edges` whose src AND dst both survived the entity cap
  before backfilling from the rest, and splits the `texts` budget between
  the flat seed search (`min(3, top_k)` slots) and hop-discovered
  support. Each surviving entity's `facts` list is separately capped (5,
  matching the width `memory_search`'s cortex-first block already uses)
  since survivors are disproportionately the fact-heavy hubs.
  Caps: `entities`=10, `edges`=15, `texts`=6, `facts`=5,
  text preview=200 chars (`mcp_server._RECALL_MAX_*`,
  `_compact_recall_text`). A reproducible in-tree probe
  (`evals/recall_cap_probe.py`, no DB/daemon) exercises the same capping
  path on a synthetic 41-entity/40-edge fixture (root fanned out to 20
  direct children, wider than the edges cap alone) and recorded a
  24.5 KB → 3.8 KB (84.4%) reduction with deep-hop entities still present
  in the result (`evals/results/recall-cap-186-payload-probe.json`,
  pinned by `tests/test_eval_evidence.py`) — a different, smaller graph
  than the live audit's, so the two byte counts aren't comparable to each
  other, only each to its own before/after.
  Docstring and `docs/guide/retrieval.md` now say `top_k` is a seed
  bound, not a result bound, and describe the quota/backfill/split
  algorithm instead of a false "existing relevance order" claim.
  `evals/regression_gate.ps1` doesn't cover this path (it drives
  `service.search`, never `memory_recall`), so it wasn't run — not an
  omission, `memory_recall` isn't gated by it.
### Added (2026-08-25 — retrieval log records the ranking components, schema v32)
- **The retrieval event log now logs what the fusion *consumed*, not just
  what it produced (#179).** Phase 0 recorded one fused score per served
  entry — which is exactly the value a Phase-1 learned head is supposed to
  predict, so the log could not train one. Each served entry now carries a
  `components` blob with the inputs already computed at ranking time:
  bi-encoder score, cross-encoder score, BM25 boost, surprise, recency
  weight, the source/supersession multipliers, and the channel that
  admitted the entry (`dense` / `slot` / `bm25` / `timeline` / `reference` /
  `contiguity`). `ce: null` (key present) marks a head the margin gate
  skipped — "served on the bi-encoder order alone" is signal, not a missing
  value. Nothing new is computed at serve time: these numbers were in hand
  and were being thrown away, and they are **not** reconstructable later —
  config is mutable at runtime, and band recency, supersession flags and
  access counts all mutate on every serve, so replaying a stored query
  against tomorrow's bank reproduces neither the scores nor the pool.
- **Schema v32 — `retrieval_events.params`:** the per-event snapshot of
  the knobs in force (effective `top_k` and keep-threshold, recency ramp,
  BM25 weight/scorer params, the reranker's fusion weight, margin gate and
  whether it fired, timeline/contiguity settings, and the call's filters).
  Additive, nullable (`NULL` = a v31-era row); the served list widened
  inside its existing JSONB column and needed no DDL.
- **`memory_stats` now reports retrieval-log liveness** — event count, use-
  label count, last-event timestamp, the kill-switch state, and a
  write-error counter. Both log-write paths swallow their exceptions by
  design, and nothing else read the table, so a silently-failing log looked
  exactly like an idle one: zero rows, green `/health`.
### Fixed (2026-08-25 — MCP transport reachability + shim param passthrough)
- **The documented LAN recipe actually works: `/mcp` no longer answers a
  non-loopback `Host` with `421` (#174).** `FastMCP(...)` was constructed
  with neither `host=` nor `transport_security=`, so the SDK's heuristic saw
  its default `127.0.0.1` and installed a loopback-only DNS-rebinding
  allowlist — while the daemon passed its own configured bind straight to
  uvicorn, never touching that setting. An operator running
  `PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0` with a token got `421 Invalid Host header`
  on every MCP call before auth or any handler ran, with `/health` and
  `/api` still working so only MCP looked dead; reverse-proxy, Tailscale,
  hostname and compose-service-name access failed the same way. The policy
  is now **explicit** in `mcp_server.transport_security_for()` and keyed on
  whether a bearer token gates the endpoint — the same reasoning the
  Console's `_browser_gate` has applied to `/api` since 2026-07-02. With a
  token, `Authorization` proves intent and any `Host` is served; tokenless,
  the loopback allowlist stays on, because the Console app deliberately does
  not `_browser_gate` `/mcp` and that allowlist is then the only guard
  between a rebinding browser and an unauthenticated bank. Explicit in both
  directions: naively forwarding the container's `0.0.0.0` to `FastMCP`
  would have flipped the same heuristic to *no* protection, quietly
  disarming the shipped loopback-published Docker default. That default is
  unchanged, and is now pinned by a test.
- **The stdio shim stops rejecting stringified list params the daemon would
  accept (#175).** The shim registered a bare `@server.call_tool()`, taking
  the SDK's `validate_input=True` default, which re-ran jsonschema against
  the RAW arguments using the upstream tool's own `inputSchema`. FastMCP
  registers with `validate_input=False` on purpose so its `pre_parse_json`
  rescue can first unwrap the JSON-in-a-string list/number params Claude
  Desktop/Code send, so `memory_store(text=…, tags='["decision"]')` failed
  through the shim — the default install transport — while succeeding over
  direct HTTP. This is the mechanism behind the long-standing "MCP
  anyOf-param stringification" note. The shim now registers
  `@server.call_tool(validate_input=False)`; the daemon is the validating
  authority. Arguments `pre_parse_json` genuinely cannot rescue (an int param
  given a non-numeric string) now reach the daemon and come back as an error
  result, so the shim also passes an upstream error through verbatim —
  returning its content alone would have tripped the shim's *own*
  `outputSchema` and replaced the daemon's real diagnosis with "Output
  validation error: outputSchema defined but no structured output returned".

### Added (2026-08-24 — session digests: a mid-density layer between raw turns and atomic facts)
- **One narrative digest per closed session episode, generated during the
  idle dream cycle and stored as a retrievable `source="digest"` band
  entry.** Ships default-OFF (`memory.dream.digest_enabled`): enablement
  gates on the sidecar quality probe (`evals/digest_sidecar_probe.py`)
  and a budget-matched BEAM verdict. Motivation: BEAM p1-b16 measured
  summarization as the local stack's floor (rag 0.4147 / hybrid 0.3823)
  and the reader×volume grid showed neither budget nor a frontier reader
  fixes it (0.47 at 48 turns) — arc-shaped questions need a coverage
  layer, not a wider window. Mechanics: digest scope is the closed
  session root (`generate_digests_stage`, cursor-tracked like outcome
  inference; the zero-start cursor backfills history when first enabled,
  capped per cycle); long sessions map-reduce over
  `digest_context_chars`; the digest write bypasses the surprise gate,
  contradiction decay, and slot extraction, and `digest` joins
  `dream.exclude_sources` so digests are never re-mined for facts. The
  session briefing's recap now renders the digest body. Eval side:
  `beam_adapter.py --digest` wraps each BEAM batch in an episode and
  answers a `hybrid_digest` arm char-budget-matched to hybrid; with the
  flag off every search call keeps the pre-digest byte-identical shape.

### Added (2026-08-24 — answer-prompt attribution ablation)
- **`evals/beam_attrib_ablation.py`: isolate the answer-prompt term of the
  Phase-1 lift.** The p1-b16 run changed budget, turn ordinals, and the
  contradiction-surfacing answer prompt at once; this re-answers its
  byte-persisted contexts with the literal pre-Phase-1 prompt (commit
  44366163) under the same local judge, so the per-row paired delta is the
  prompt effect alone and the ordinal term falls out of the grid by
  subtraction. A pin test holds live-prompt == old-prompt + exactly the
  contradiction sentence, so prompt drift breaks the instrument loudly
  instead of silently widening the ablation. Per-row resumable, local-only
  (zero subscription tokens).

### Changed (2026-08-23 — Phase-1 BEAM fixes from the reader-sweep verdict)
- **The BEAM answer prompt now surfaces genuine contradictions instead of
  silently resolving them.** BEAM plants conflicting claims and
  rubric-checks that the answer says the record conflicts; the old prompt
  ordered newest-wins resolution, so every arm retrieved the evidence and
  scored 0-0.25 on contradiction_resolution (2026-08-22 autopsy). Value
  updates still resolve to the current value. The LME answer prompt is
  deliberately unchanged (the regression gate re-answers pinned contexts
  with it).
- **Stored BEAM turns now carry `[session N, turn M]` ordinals** — the
  free ordering metadata event_ordering questions need, previously
  discarded at ingest (Cognee's retrieved passages carry the equivalent
  headers). Banks stored before the stamp are not byte-comparable.
- **`beam_adapter.py --rag-top-k`** widens both arms together (the pinned
  search serves rag and the hybrid raw block), so budget-matching
  survives the knob; both knobs validate before either module global
  mutates, and rows/summaries record the effective `rag_top_k`.

### Added (2026-08-22 — BEAM reader/volume sweep, GPU-free)
- **`evals/beam_reader_sweep.py`: measure the two unmeasured legs of the
  Cognee-0.79 gap decomposition** — the answerer (frontier vs local 27B)
  and the context volume (their ~24.7K served tokens/question vs our
  ~3.2K) — without the GPU. The rag arm never touches the extractor, so
  banks build extraction-free on the CPU embedder; one top-48 serve per
  question is sliced into budget arms (rag6/rag16/rag48 — 48 turns ≈
  26K tokens ≈ Cognee's budget), answered by a frontier CLI model under
  the BEAM answer prompt and judged with the same instrument as the
  `rejudge-opus5` artifact, so the existing opus-judged qwen-reader rag
  row pairs directly against rag6 for a pure reader effect. Retrieval is
  identical across budgets by construction. `beam_rejudge`'s CLI call
  gains proper `--system-prompt` handling (argv-length fallback, the
  claude_shim contract) shared by both scripts.

### Changed (2026-08-21 — hybrid arm budget-matched to the rag control by default)
- **`HYBRID_TOP_K` is now 6 (was 3), equal to `RAG_TOP_K`, in the LME/BEAM
  bench harness.** The hybrid arm previously served half the rag control's
  raw-turn budget, so every hybrid-vs-rag comparison confounded the fact
  spine with a halved turn window — the 2026-07-30 ceiling-e2e autopsy and
  the 2026-08-21 BEAM review both traced hybrid "losses" to exactly this.
  Hybrid is now a superset of the control by construction. Bench rows
  record the effective `hybrid_top_k`; rows without the key predate the
  flip and were served at 3. Pre-flip artifacts are NOT comparable to
  post-flip hybrid numbers. The regression-gate arm1 pinned contexts were
  built at 3 and splice raw blocks verbatim, so the gate is mechanically
  unaffected — but its hybrid arm no longer represents the shipped
  default until a fresh-extract re-baseline (`regression_gate.ps1
  -Establish` after a new arm1 extract), noted at the constant.

### Added (2026-08-21 — BEAM banks and served contexts persist)
- **BEAM runs no longer discard their consolidated state.** Each row now
  carries the exact served context per arm plus the structured serve
  state (`parts`: pinned raw turns, memory turns, fact lines, events), and
  each chat's consolidated fact bank (with per-slot history chains) is
  dumped to `evals/results/banks/beam-<tier>-<extractor>-<tag>/`
  (gitignored, like all bank dumps). A serving-knob rerun or re-judge now
  recomposes from persisted state instead of re-paying the ~5h
  ingest/extraction phase — the qwen38 rerun had to re-ingest precisely
  because the first run kept nothing. Turns are not dumped (they are
  verbatim in the static BEAM `chat.json`); chronicle event serving is
  the one channel that still needs a live bank.

### Added (2026-08-21 — BEAM judge-transfer and budget-match instrumentation)
- **`evals/beam_rejudge.py`: re-judge an existing BEAM run's recorded
  answers with a frontier judge** (headless `claude -p`, pooled workers,
  never the production shim), using the same upstream
  `unified_llm_judge_base_prompt`, one call per rubric item. Retrieval and
  answering are not re-run, so any score movement is pure judge effect —
  the judge-transfer measurement `beam-100k-verdict.json` (2026-08-03)
  left as the open decision blocking any comparison against the
  GPT-judged published numbers (Cognee 0.79 @ 100K etc.). Writes
  `<source>.rejudge-<tag>.jsonl` + a paired summary carrying
  original-vs-rejudged scores per arm/type and a seeded stability sample
  (pairs judged twice) that bounds what a delta can claim, since a CLI
  judge is not bit-reproducible. Resumable per row; the source artifact
  is never modified.
- **`beam_adapter.py --hybrid-top-k N` and `--arms a,b`**: the bench's
  hybrid arm serves `HYBRID_TOP_K=3` raw turns against the rag arm's 6,
  so hybrid-vs-rag deltas confound the fact spine with a halved turn
  budget — the same asymmetry the 2026-07-30 ceiling-e2e diagnosis found
  on LongMemEval. `--hybrid-top-k 6` budget-matches the arms (default
  unchanged: prior artifacts stay byte-identical), `--arms` skips arms a
  partial rerun doesn't need, and rows/summaries now record the
  effective `hybrid_top_k` so artifacts self-describe.

### Fixed (2026-08-21 — sweep-thread storage call could wedge the Postgres connection)
- **`prune_retrieval_log` (the v31 retrieval-log retention pass) now takes
  the service lock around its storage call.** It was the one storage
  mutation on the dream-sweep tick that ran unlocked, so the sweep thread
  could interleave its psycopg transaction block with a lock-holding
  writer's on the shared connection. psycopg then raises "transaction
  commit at the wrong nesting level" and the connection is left
  permanently in-transaction: every subsequent dream sweep and episode
  write-through fails, `/health` still reports ok, and the episode
  write-through spins INSERTs inside the dead transaction — in the
  2026-08-21 incident this pinned a Postgres core for 2½ hours until a
  daemon restart. A new static guard test
  (`tests/test_service_lock_discipline.py`) walks `service.py` and fails
  on any storage/graph call outside `with self._lock` that is not in the
  audited caller-holds-lock allowlist, so the next unlocked addition
  fails in CI instead of in production.

### Added (2026-08-20 — retrieval event log, schema v31)
- **Every search now feeds a training log for a future learned reranker.**
  Schema **v31** adds `retrieval_events` (one append-only row per
  `memory_search`: query text, the ranked served list as JSONB with entry
  ids/scores/ranks, writer session/episode) and `retrieval_uses` (implicit
  relevance labels: a `memory_get`/`memory_reinforce` on a served entry in
  the same session credits the most recent event that served it, within
  `memory.retrieval_log.use_window_seconds`, default 1 h). Purely
  observational — no retrieval behaviour changes, and a logging failure
  can never break the search or fetch it rides on. Served ids carry no FK
  (entries are evictable); labels CASCADE from their event; events are
  pruned on the dream-sweep tick after
  `memory.retrieval_log.retention_days` (default 365). Kill-switch
  `memory.retrieval_log.enabled` plus both knobs exposed in the Console
  config panel (live, no restart). File mode skips silently. This is
  Phase 0 of the learned-reranker plan: the (query, served, used) tuples
  accrue passively until there is enough supervision to train a fusion
  head against the pre-registered pure-cosine gate.

### Fixed (2026-08-20 — cache-retention task dead on Store-installed PowerShell)
- **The weekly build-cache retention task never ran on hosts where
  PowerShell 7 is a Store/MSIX install.** `ops/install-cache-retention.ps1`
  registered the action as a bare `pwsh.exe`, which Task Scheduler resolves
  against the machine `PATH` — where an MSIX install does not appear. The
  task registered fine, reported Ready, and fired on schedule, but every
  run exited `0x80070002` (file not found) before the retention script
  started: a silent permanent failure, found live with the cache at 23.6 GB
  against its 20 GB ceiling. The installer now registers an absolute path,
  preferring the stable per-user app-execution alias
  (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\pwsh.exe`) over the versioned
  `WindowsApps` package directory, which changes on every Store update and
  would re-plant the same failure. Existing registrations need one
  re-run of the installer to pick up the fix.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-20 — the flat store default, the zero-config lite tier, and pull-not-build images

### Changed (2026-08-20 — session briefing teaches contested-slot resolution)
- **The served memory-loop briefing (and its `examples/CLAUDE.memory.md`
  mirror) now tells agents how to settle a contested fact** — via
  `memory_fact_resolve`, not a `memory_fact_set` re-assert (which only
  contests the slot further). Surfaced by the 0.14.0 docs currency pass:
  the briefing taught corrections but never the resolve path, while the
  consolidation quarantine makes contenders more common.

### Changed (2026-08-20 — daemon container memory cap)
- **The daemon container now ships with a hard memory cap** (`mem_limit`,
  default `4g`, override via `PSEUDOLIFE_DAEMON_MEM_LIMIT` in `ops/.env`;
  the memory+swap total is pinned to the memory limit, so the container
  gets no swap — by design). Steady state is ~2.8 GB with
  the default embedder loaded; the cap fences the 2026-08-04 incident where
  the daemon transiently allocated 21 GB RSS within minutes of boot (root
  cause still under investigation) — the failure mode becomes a clean
  container restart (`restart: unless-stopped`) instead of a host-wide
  memory event. A capped daemon has been serving continuously under a
  tighter 3.5 GB limit since 2026-08-19 with no restarts.

### Fixed (2026-08-19 — review-pass hardening of judged-run integrity)
- **Pre-merge review of the 3.8 migration branch surfaced 11 findings; all
  applied.** Shipped-path corrections: the deep-dream judge (`judge_url`)
  constructor now passes `extractor_max_tokens` explicitly (it silently
  inherited the constructor default), and the constructor's
  `timeout_seconds` default is synced 20→240 s alongside `max_tokens`
  (half-synced defaults recreated the documented big-budget/tiny-timeout
  claims:0 failure; both now lockstep-tested). Eval integrity:
  `Get-RunningQwenConfig` now returns `'foreign'` for a llama-server not
  serving the expected GGUF and `Start-Qwen` refuses to reuse or displace
  it (a leftover 3.6 rollback server could previously masquerade as
  reproducible); `-Fast` pins `MTP=1` against ambient env state;
  `live_replay_judge.py` and `retention_interval_eval.py` pin
  `enable_thinking:false` (the 3.8 server default is thinking-on with the
  3.6-era budget cap retired); the bench env knobs are stamped into
  summary artifacts, may not override `messages`/`model`/
  `chat_template_kwargs`, and accept `xhigh` (the template's real level
  set); `judge_says_yes` is position-anchored (an echoed gold
  `\boxed{yes}` no longer scores as a pass; `\boxed{\text{yes}}` and
  8-token-truncated boxes now parse — both directions test-pinned);
  `judge_ladder.py` records its thinking config in the artifact and pins
  `max_tokens=400`, as does `lesson_synthesis_bench.py` (measured budgets
  decoupled from the extraction default); overnight preflight resolves
  the engine/GGUF/launcher from `qwen_server.ps1` instead of gating on
  the retired turboq `.bat`.

### Changed (2026-08-19 — LME-V2 slice verdict + 3.8 extraction pace)
- **LME-V2 `procedure` paired comparison** (56 shared questions, off-ramp
  taken at the user's option-2 decision; artifact
  `lme-v2-qwen38-vs-slice2-paired56.json`): on the preregistered primary
  metric (deterministic eval) Qwen3.8 ≥ 3.6 on every arm — cortex 0.143 vs
  0.054 (+0.089, 6 wins / 1 loss), rag +0.018, hybrid −0.018 (both noise).
  The secondary LLM-judge metric drops on rag/hybrid, consistent with the
  measured 3.8 no-think judge strictness and confounded by judge identity;
  the primary metric carries the verdict.
  **CORRECTED 2026-08-25 (scorer defect #173): every eval-arm number in
  this entry is superseded.** Re-scored with the anchored multiple-choice
  fallback (`lme-v2-qwen38-vs-slice2-paired56-rescored-strictmc.json`):
  the cortex delta +0.089 → **+0.036** (3.6 scores 0.054, 3.8 scores
  0.089; 6W/1L → 3W/1L; sign-test p 0.125 → 0.625), rag +0.018 →
  **+0.018** (8W/7L → 7W/6L), hybrid −0.018 → **−0.036** (8W/9L →
  7W/9L). The judge arms are unaffected and reproduce this entry
  exactly. The verdict's *direction* survives; its size does not.
- **Operational finding: 3.8 extraction is ~3.5–4× slower than 3.6**
  (34 min vs ~10.6 min per extraction-heavy lme_v2 row; ladder extract
  33.0 s vs 9.0 s at 13.4 vs 1.4 tok/q). Scale all 3.6-era runtime
  estimates accordingly before scheduling 3.8 extraction workloads (BEAM
  deliberately not run for this reason — pending its own scheduling
  decision).

### Changed (2026-08-19 — bench engine b10488 + extractor token-default sync)
- **Bench engine bumped b10453 → b10488**: byte-identical output on a fixed
  16k-token probe (same content hash), ~4% faster decode, and the
  regression-gate canary re-passed on the new engine (std 0.0000, PASS vs
  the committed 3.8 baseline — artifacts:
  `regression_gate-2026-08-19-canary-b10488-n2.agg.json` and
  `engine-b10488-probe-20260819.json`). Mainline MTP measured on this build is
  byte-deterministic run-to-run and verdict-lossless vs stock
  (`judge-determinism-check-qwen38-mtp.json`); extraction-phase adoption
  is a follow-up design (answer/judge calls gain nothing from it).
- **`OpenAICompatExtractor` default `max_tokens` 400 → 2048**, matching
  `DreamConfig.extractor_max_tokens` (lockstep-pinned by test). The dream
  extractor path always passed the config value, but the deep-dream
  judge (`judge_url`) constructor did not — it now passes
  `extractor_max_tokens` explicitly (2026-08-19 review finding);
  the stale default only reached direct constructors — including
  `judge_ladder.py`, whose per-batch judge budget floor rises from 960 to
  2048 (no behavioral change measured: verdicts are short and were never
  truncating).

### Changed (2026-08-17 — GPU bench server migrated to Qwen3.8-27B)
- **`evals/qwen_server.ps1` now serves Qwen3.8-27B-UD-Q4_K_XL on the
  llama.cpp b10453 engine** (the 3.6-era b9371 binary cannot load 3.8's
  hybrid DeltaNet architecture). Reproducible config keeps the eval
  protocol (q8_0 KV, cache-ram 0, ctx-checkpoints 0, MTP off) with the
  official 3.8 thinking sampler and the model's embedded chat template
  (`reasoning_effort=medium` server default; per-request
  `enable_thinking:false` verified still honoured, so extractor call
  sites are unchanged). `-Fast` now selects mainline embedded-MTP
  speculation instead of the retired TurboQuant fork; the running-config
  discriminator also matches `--spec-type draft-mtp`. Rollback:
  `evals/qwen_server.ps1.bak-qwen36-20260817` + the 3.6 model/engine
  still on disk.
- **Byte-determinism re-proven for the new stack**
  (`evals/results/judge-determinism-check-qwen38.json`): 3 replicates at
  gate and e2e scale, 0 verdict flips, 0 response diffs, std 0.0000 on
  every arm — judged numbers on the 3.8 server are trustworthy.
- **Regression-gate baseline re-established** for the 3.8 answerer/judge
  (`regression_gate.baseline.json`, n=3): rag 0.5897 / cortex 0.6923 /
  hybrid 0.7692 (3.6 was 0.6282 / 0.7051 / 0.7692 — the old values
  remain in git history and the dated establish artifacts).
- **3.8 campaign artifacts** (tagged, canonical 3.6 files untouched):
  ladder rung `qwen-27b-qwen38` gold 1.0 / stale 0.0 (extract 33.0 s and
  13.4 tok/q vs 3.6's 9.0 s / 1.4 — richer extraction, same gate);
  KU-oracle `ceiling-v38` n=3 rag 0.8590 / cortex 0.6667 (both equal to
  the 3.6 ceiling-e2e aggregates) / hybrid 0.8462 (+0.013) / cascade
  0.8462 (−0.090 — root-caused to reduced abstention: 22/78 cortex
  "don't know" vs 32/78, so fewer rag rescues); judge ladder
  `judge-ladder-qwen38-20260817.json` false-reject 0.567 vs 0.267 and
  auto-reject precision 0.844 vs 0.918 (regression; shadow-mode default
  and the Opus-class auto-reject floor already shipped are unaffected);
  stance GATE PASS (v8 capture 0.97); misleading-recall harm 0.00;
  gate-firing 1.15% of gateable; events-quantity smoke **FAIL** — the
  seeded "April 15th to 22nd" range survives in `date_phrase` but the
  check requires description-field verbatim (field-placement drift, not
  data loss; checker-vs-prompt decision pending). Docs front-door
  numbers still cite 3.6 and are deliberately not switched in this
  change — promotion needs its own docs-currency pass with
  `tests/test_eval_evidence.py` rows updated alongside.

### Added (2026-08-17 — thinking-judge experiment knob)
- **`OpenAICompatExtractor(judge_thinking=True)`** (daemon never passes it;
  shipped judge payloads stay byte-identical, guarded by
  `tests/test_judge_thinking_payload.py`): unpins the judge call's
  `enable_thinking:false` so the server/template reasoning default governs,
  with +4096 reasoning headroom. Exposed as `judge_ladder.py --thinking`.
  Finding (artifact `judge-ladder-qwen38-thinking-20260817.json`): the 3.8
  judge regression is mostly thinking-deprivation — with thinking, false
  rejects 17→11, auto-reject precision 0.844→0.920 (above 3.6's 0.918),
  accept precision 0.632→0.842, still deterministic (0 flip rows), at
  ~4.7× verdict latency and 0.969 coverage. Server-side reasoning kwargs
  are inert for every shipped call site while the per-request pin exists —
  a reasoning_effort=xhigh server reproduced the non-thinking ladder
  byte-identically (`judge-ladder-qwen38-xhigh-20260817.json`).

### Fixed (2026-08-17 — the shadow verdict actually reaches the reviewer)
- **The Console review queue now shows the judge's pre-judgment**: the
  shadow verdict survived only in the deep response — the
  `graph_review.merge_candidates` listing (what the Atlas Review panel
  renders) dropped the v30 judge fields, so a human working the queue
  never saw them. The listing now carries the `judge` block and the panel
  renders it as a verdict chip (accept/reject/leave with confidence;
  tooltip = the model's one-line reason and which model judged). The
  `/dream` Step-C brief tells agents to treat the block as a lead, never
  a decision.

### Added (2026-08-16 — autonomous Step-C judge: the dream answers its own review queue, schema v30)
- **The sweep now judges pending merge proposals** (`deep_dream.judge_mode`,
  default `shadow`): a bounded batch per sweep is sent to the configured
  model — the dream extractor by default, or a dedicated
  `deep_dream.judge_url` endpoint — with the same evidence pack the review
  surfaces show, and the verdict (`accept`/`reject`/`leave` + confidence +
  note) is recorded on the proposal row and surfaced beside the evidence in
  review payloads. Schema **v30** adds the five nullable
  `entity_proposals.judge_*` columns; the verdict is an opinion — the
  durable record stays `merge_decisions`, written only when a decision path
  ratifies it.
- **`auto-reject` mode** additionally applies reject verdicts at/above
  `judge_reject_min_confidence` (`decided_by='dream-judge'`, pair
  dismissed). Accept verdicts are never auto-applied at this phase —
  folds wait for a decision path with stronger guarantees (two-vote
  design, phase 2). Goal per the 2026-08-16 maintainer directive: a
  memory system by agents for agents, with minimal human interaction —
  the human queue should hold only what machine judgment genuinely
  cannot settle.
- **Judge-model ladder** (`evals/judge_ladder.py` +
  `evals/data/judge_eval_20260816.json`, 129 evidence-backed rows from the
  two ratified 2026-08-16 triage rounds, 30 accept / 99 reject): runs the
  SHIPPED judge code path (same prompt, serialization, and batch size)
  against Claude arms via the CLI shim, the local Qwen bench server, and
  the deployed sidecar, scoring reject-precision / false-reject-rate /
  accept-precision with replicates and majority vote, plus a simulation of
  exactly what auto-reject at confidence >= 0.8 would apply. Measured floor
  (artifact: `evals/results/judge-ladder-20260816.json`): **calibration,
  not accuracy, gates autonomy** — all arms make similar raw errors, but
  only Opus-class knows which verdicts it is unsure of. Auto-reject
  precision at the 0.8 gate: fable-5 1.0 (0 false in 73), opus-5 0.9867
  (1 false in 75), sonnet-5 0.9589 (3 false), qwen-27b 0.9175 (its
  confidence is uninformative: every reject including all 8 false ones sat
  at >= 0.8), sidecar-e4b 0.9583 but with 67% coverage and 71% agreement —
  the deployed extractor can extract but cannot judge. Consequence: the
  shipped default stays `shadow` for any endpoint; flipping `auto-reject`
  on is measured-safe only with an Opus-class (or better) `judge_url`.

### Fixed (2026-08-16 — round-2 review-queue noise: hub contexts, immortal dismissals, junk re-review)
- **Scan-fallback hub cap** (`deep_dream.max_fallback_mentions`, default 30):
  a trace-less entity whose token-mention fallback matched an outsized share
  of the corpus got a corpus-centroid context vector and paired
  promiscuously — on the 2026-08-16 live bank `pseudolife-pg` matched
  301/695 embedded entries (its short `pg` token is dropped by the Jaccard
  tokenizer, leaving one generic token) and filed 9 cross-hub merge pairs in
  a single pass. The cap applies to the fallback scan only; trace-backed
  mentions are never capped. Default is the measured p90 of the
  fallback-set size distribution.
- **Duplicate-finding dismissals now key on the entity's stored canonical**,
  not `norm_name(display)`: an entity minted from a bare name and later
  display-enriched (canonical `gnd`, display `GND (Enshrouded server)`)
  re-listed after every dismissal because the analyzer filters on stored
  canonicals — the dismissal row could never match. Old mismatched rows are
  inert; re-dismissing once with the fix persists correctly.
- **The stateless duplicate listing applies `merge_veto`**, matching the
  proposal-filing paths: numeric-substitution and event-slug sibling pairs
  (`pgvector 0.8.5` ↔ `0.8.6`, two dated snapshot files) no longer clutter
  the Console review queue with pairs filing already refuses. File/concept
  relate suggestions are unaffected.
- **Reviewed junk deletions are durable and tombstoned**: accepting a junk
  proposal now records a `merge_decisions` row (`into_display` NULL) before
  the delete — previously the proposal row CASCADEd away with the entity
  and no record survived, so the same name re-minted and re-queued for a
  second verdict. The deep dream now auto-deletes a re-minted, re-flagged
  tombstoned name at the detector's own degree bar (`junk_max_degree`),
  while never-judged names keep the zero-structure auto-delete guard.
  `merge_decision_stats` excludes all junk rows (`into_display IS NULL`) so
  detector precision keeps measuring merges only.
  *(Narrowed 2026-08-25, #177: the tombstone branch relaxes the degree bar
  only — a fact-bearing entity is never auto-deleted. See the entry at the
  top of `[Unreleased]`.)*
- **Lesson-synthesis tallies journaled into `dream_runs`**
  (`lesson_signals` / `lessons_written` / `lessons_deduped` merged into the
  run row's tallies post-commit): the dedup counter previously existed only
  in the transient dream-run result, making gate behavior invisible to
  history.

### Changed (2026-08-15 — the flat band is the default store; the continuum becomes an opt-in preset)
- **`memory.miras.preset` defaults to `flat`**: one band at the
  continuum's total capacity (5,250), `balanced` retention — byte-for-byte
  the ablation arm the flat-band verdict measured as tying the 8-band
  continuum on every preregistered gate. The `continuum` preset (and its
  deprecated aliases) stays in the registry as the one-line rollback; the
  multi-band machinery (promotion, demotion cascade, per-tier retention)
  remains in the tree, exercised by its invariant tests. The four breaks
  a naive flip would have caused are fixed in the same change: capacity
  eviction under one band is now an intentional, counted
  (`memory_stats().true_drops`), logged true drop; unknown `bands=`
  filter names raise with the valid set instead of silently matching
  nothing; file-mode state restore routes saved bands whose name left
  the preset into the first band (previously lost every entry); and
  hydration reconciles stale `entries.band` stamps to the configured
  layout, write-through, idempotently — covering preset changes in both
  directions and legacy `.pt` imports. Console: the Observatory renders
  a single-band store as a capacity meter ("Memory store", no degenerate
  ladder), the Stream hides the constant band chip, and the two inert
  depth-recency knobs left the config surface (fields remain for
  multi-band configs). Docs/README/atlas/i18n/llms surfaces audited to
  match. The deploy cutover and rollback path are documented in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-15-flat-band-migration-design.md`.

### Added (2026-08-15 — distractor-scale probe: accumulation measurably hurts retrieval)
- **First positive evidence for curation**: a preregistered offline probe
  (`evals/distractor_scale_probe.py`, G0-validated mirror, no judge)
  found evidence-in-top-6 falls monotonically as off-topic distractors
  accumulate — 0.830 at own-haystack scale to 0.597 at ~7k entries
  (paired delta +0.233, p < 0.0001, 78 questions) — while BM25 latency
  stays under 1 s until ~11.4k entries (~0.088 ms/entry): quality binds
  long before latency. Consequence recorded in the spec
  (`2026-08-15-distractor-scale-probe-preregistration.md`): a future
  sweep agent has a measured recovery ceiling (~23 points at 15x);
  orthogonal to the flat-band migration (dilution hits banded and flat
  pooling identically). Artifact:
  `evals/results/distractor-scale-probe-2026-08-15.json`.

### Added (2026-08-15 — flat-band verdict: the preregistered rerun + steelman campaign)
- **The 8-band continuum's ablation was rerun under the current (v25+)
  retrieval backbone with six preregistered steelman edge cases; verdict:
  migrate flat, at the maintainer's leisure** — every gate came back a
  TIE (spec + full gates table:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-14-flat-band-verdict-preregistration.md`).
  The July effects evaporated in BOTH directions: the significant flat
  ranking win (rag/hist −9.0 pts) is gone under
  Qwen3-Embedding + global-pool BM25, and the 31.1% write-side eviction
  loss measured pre-cascade code that no longer exists (survival now
  loss 0.0 both ingest arms; the flat-ingest arm answers byte-identically
  to flat ranking). Under forced eviction at matched capacity 257 the
  band retention stack ties a single flat policy on gold-evidence
  survival (0.459 vs 0.465, p = 1.0); 202 real recorded queries diverge
  heavily between the read paths (top-6 0.876) but a blind
  position-swapped judge shows no significant preference (banded 0.5508,
  p = 0.130); flat store latency at 5250 resident marginally misses the
  1.5x bar on the median (1.59x, +6.5 ms — perf caveat, not a blocker).
  A naive flat migration has four smoke-proven breaks
  (`evals/results/abl25-e4-flat-migration-smoke.json`), delete-on-evict
  restoration being the worst — they are the migration PR's mandatory
  work-item list. No migration is implemented by this change.
- **Harness: v25-faithful mirror + eviction-policy tooling in
  `evals/band_ablation.py`** — the offline ranking mirror gained the
  production-default BM25 pool (real `BM25Index`, global candidates) and
  recency-off path (G0 fidelity vs live search: 1.000 on all three
  rebuild passes), `--tag-prefix` so `abl25`/`wabl25` artifacts can
  never overwrite the July canonical files, a `scaled` band preset
  (proportional capacity scale-down so BOTH arms genuinely evict), and
  an `evidence` subcommand (per-turn `has_answer` survival + drop-set
  evidence fraction, paired sign-flip permutation). New
  `evals/live_replay_flat_ab.py` (transcript-harvested real-query A/B
  over restored bank copies; aggregates only — query texts stay
  untracked) and `evals/live_replay_judge.py` (blind position-swapped
  preference, aborts on server failure instead of degrading to fake
  ties). `evals/bench_store_latency.py` gained `--preset flat`,
  `--dim`, and a retrieve-latency pass. `Start-Qwen` gained `-Ctx`
  (KV capacity only; verified byte-identical verdicts at 32768 vs
  100000 — used when desktop VRAM pressure would OOM the full 100k KV).

### Changed (2026-08-14 — Docker tier PostgreSQL 16 → 18: lite dumps now restore straight in)
- **`pseudolife-pg` is PostgreSQL 18** (pgvector 0.8.6, `pgvector/pgvector:pg18`
  base): aligns the Docker tier with the lite tier's embedded PostgreSQL 18,
  so a `pseudolife-mcp backup` dump restores directly into the Docker tier —
  previously blocked because PG 18 dumps carry PG 17+ `SET` parameters that
  PG 16 rejected. A PG major bump cannot reuse the old data volume:
  `ops/migrate-pg18.ps1` runs the cutover (backup → quiesce → dump →
  new external volume → restore under `ON_ERROR_STOP` → exact count
  verification → daemon health), retaining the PG 16 volume untouched as
  the rollback. The 16→18 restore was rehearsed against a scratch pg18
  container with a real bank dump before any of this shipped. **Mount-path
  fix bundled**: PG 18 images moved `PGDATA` under `/var/lib/postgresql/18/`
  and declare `VOLUME /var/lib/postgresql`, so the compose mount moved from
  `/var/lib/postgresql/data` to `/var/lib/postgresql` — keeping the old
  path would have silently left the cluster on an anonymous volume. CI's
  service container and the GHCR pg-image tags (`18`, `18-<version>`)
  move with it.

### Added (2026-08-14 — prebuilt images: the Docker tier can pull instead of build)
- **GHCR image publishing** (`images` job in `.github/workflows/release.yml`):
  publishing a GitHub release now also pushes
  `ghcr.io/pseudogiant-xr/pseudolife-daemon:{<version>,latest}` and
  `ghcr.io/pseudogiant-xr/pseudolife-pg:{18,18-<version>}` (16 at this
  entry's writing; the same-day PG 18 bump moved the tags), downstream of
  the same human-approved `publish` gate as PyPI and the MCP registry —
  one release click still lands every surface. The new
  `ops/docker-compose.ghcr.yml` overlay consumes them
  (`docker compose -f ops/docker-compose.yml -f ops/docker-compose.ghcr.yml
  pull` + `up -d`) so a first install needs no local image build; the base
  compose file, `ops/install.*`, and `ops/update.ps1`'s local-build deploy
  flow are unchanged. The extractor sidecar stays build-local.

### Added (2026-08-14 — zero-config lite tier: `pip install pseudolife-mcp[lite]`)
- **Embedded PostgreSQL storage** (`pseudolife_memory/storage/embedded_pg.py`):
  with the new `[lite]` extra installed (`pg0-embedded`, pinned
  `>=0.15.1,<0.16` — bundles PostgreSQL 18 + pgvector 0.8.5), a daemon
  started without `PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_DATABASE_URL` now provisions and
  manages an embedded Postgres under the data dir instead of silently
  dropping to v0.1 file mode. Resolution happens once, at the daemon
  entrypoint only — `MemoryService`, the `embedded` stdio escape hatch,
  and file-mode tests are untouched. Explicit DSN always wins;
  `PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_STORAGE=files` opts out. File-mode fallback is now
  announced with a startup warning instead of being silent. Guards, all
  verified live on Windows 2026-08-14: cross-PG-major pgdata is refused
  loudly (never re-initialized), non-ASCII data paths are refused on
  Windows with a remedy (the embedded runtime cannot handle them),
  attach-vs-own lifecycle (a process only ever stops an instance it
  started), and nothing in shipped code can delete a data dir. When the
  lite tier engages, the default data dir moves from cwd-relative
  `./data` to a stable per-user location — a per-launch-directory
  Postgres bank would scatter real data.
- **`pseudolife-mcp backup`** (`backup_cli.py`): tier-agnostic backup
  for the pip tiers, mirroring `ops/backup.ps1`'s shape — `pg_dump |
  gzip` of the bank (`--no-owner --no-acl` so the artifact restores
  under the Docker tier's `pseudolife` role — rehearsed against a
  role-named Postgres in the test suite; bundled lite pg_dump preferred,
  PATH fallback) plus a state archive of the data dir (excluding
  `embedded_pg/` and `backups/`). Artifact names
  (`pseudolife_lite_memory-*` / `pseudolife_lite_state-*`) are disjoint
  from `ops/backup.*`'s so a shared backups directory is safe: neither
  tool's rotation or restore-picker can touch the other's files. 7-day
  rotation runs only after a successful fresh backup, never rotates
  dumps on a run that produced none, and only deletes files the tool
  itself wrote. A backup never initializes a bank that doesn't exist,
  and never stops an embedded instance it merely attached to.

### Changed (2026-08-14 — the v10 update-anchored stance prompt is the live extraction prompt)
- **`facts.stance` is now populated in production**: the live dream
  extraction prompt moved v5 → v10 (`ku_op_prompt_v10_stance_update.txt`,
  construction-pinned), activating the schema-v29 stance plumbing that
  shipped dormant. v10 implements the bank-diff forensics hint that
  killed v8 — an explicit "a hedged update is STILL an update" sentence
  and a worked example that reuses the base example's own deploy-target
  slot as a later hedged update, reinforcing the consolidation anchor v8
  diluted. Gates (same-window v5 control, zero rag-control noise floor):
  stance capture 0.919 with false-stance 0.00 and hedged-fact recovery
  0.30→0.925; ladder 1.0/0.0 both replicates; KU-oracle cortex exactly
  unchanged (0.731 vs 0.731, net 0, p=1.0 — v8's −0.115 regression
  repaired); hybrid 0.859 vs 0.897 (2W/5L, p=0.45, not significant)
  accepted by maintainer decision as a SOAK WATCH ITEM — production soak
  review due ~2026-08-21, alongside a planned v11 iteration targeting
  the residual bank drift measured by the new
  `evals/analyze_bank_drift.py` (slot ratio 1.20 / key jaccard 0.49 vs a
  clean 1.00/1.00 cross-window v5 floor; the instrument is validated
  against the v8/v9 failure banks and reads as a tripwire, not a
  predictor). Artifacts: `stance-v10-ku-paired-verdict.json`,
  `longmemeval-ku-oracle-qwen-27b-sg2-{v5,v10}.summary.json`,
  `stance-probe-20260813-v10.json`, `bank-drift-sg2-v5-vs-v10.json`,
  `bank-drift-crosswindow-v5-floor.json`.

### Added (2026-08-13 — GPU-busy guard in the bench server helper)
- **`Start-Qwen` refuses instead of displacing when the GPU is in use**
  (`Test-GpuBusy` in `evals/qwen_server.ps1`): more than 5 GB VRAM held
  by anything, while the wanted config is not already the thing serving,
  now returns `$false` with a hold message — never launch onto a busy
  GPU, never stop what is running. This deliberately includes the
  helper's own leftover other-config server (replacing it now takes
  `Stop-Qwen` first or an explicit `-Force`): the config discriminator
  is MTP-only, so a foreign llama-server — e.g. the daily driver, which
  binds the same port — is indistinguishable from a leftover bench
  server, and the safe default is to touch nothing. Fails open without
  `nvidia-smi` (CPU-only environments are not blocked). Maintainer rule
  set 2026-08-13 after an unguarded launch piled a 27B load onto a busy
  GPU.

### Added (2026-08-13 — misleading-recall probe: measuring the harm a wrong memory does)
- **`evals/misleading_recall_probe.py`** — the eval category ContextWeave
  (arXiv:2608.04830) showed retrieval-shaped benches lack: paired
  scenarios where a confidently-worded, WRONG memory block (cortex-fact-
  or lesson-shaped) accompanies, or replaces, the evidence that refutes
  it. Deterministic substring scoring (no judge), four arms per item,
  battery integrity pinned by `tests/test_misleading_recall_probe.py`.
  Baseline on the reproducible bench server
  (`evals/results/misleading-recall-20260813-baseline.json`, 12
  scenarios, evidence ceiling 1.00): with the refuting evidence IN
  context the answerer never follows the wrong memory (harm rate 0.00,
  placebo 0.00) — but in the cortex-only regime, with nothing to
  contradict it, the unchecked-follow rate is 0.67 and abstention only
  0.17, despite the prompt stating memory may be stale. That 0.67 is
  the quantified motivation for serving-side mitigations (contested /
  stance / staleness rendering) and the baseline they will be measured
  against. Caveats recorded in the artifact: single battery, one
  answerer (Qwen3.6-27B), and negation-shaped traps can leak the gold
  answer (one item; the leak direction is conservative — it can only
  understate the follow rate).

### Added (2026-08-13 — slot-index shadow verification catches maintenance bypasses at query time)
- **Sampled shadow check on the slot-token index**
  (`memory.slot_index_shadow_rate`, default `0.01`): on ~1% of non-dirty
  slot-pool queries the index is recomputed from the band entries and
  compared by membership (`token -> {(band, entry)}`) against the live
  copy. A divergence means some mutation path neither extended the index
  nor flagged it dirty — the bug class the 2026-07-12 slot-index audit
  found three of post-deploy, previously guarded only at test time. It is
  logged, counted in `stats()` (`slot_index_shadow_divergences`), and
  self-repaired by adopting the fresh copy, so a missed maintenance hook
  degrades to a warning instead of silently serving stale or missing
  entries. Ordinals are excluded from the comparison — extend-in-place
  numbering legitimately differs from a rebuild's. `0.0` disables;
  `1.0` checks every query (used by the tests). Pattern borrowed from
  the shadow-verified derived projections in SuperLocalMemory's
  semantic channel (reviewed 2026-08-13).

### Added (2026-08-12 — epistemic stance survives consolidation (schema v29) + provenance-span gate)
- **`facts.stance` (schema v29)**: the dream pass is a compression step,
  and compression strips qualifiers — "we'll *probably* move to Postgres
  18" consolidated into a confident canonical fact. Claims may now carry
  a `stance` field (the note's own hedge words, ≤48 chars, parsed at the
  extractor boundary like `op`), stored as a nullable labelled column on
  `facts` and on `CortexRecord`, surfaced in `memory_fact_get` / recall
  cortex blocks / `history` only when set. Semantics: the LATEST
  asserting write owns the stance — a confirm or supersede without one
  clears the stored hedge (a confident restatement removes it). Stance is
  never an input to confidence, ranking, or supersession (model-emitted
  and steerable by note text, the same trust class as claim `origin`).
  `NULL` = asserted plainly, so the migration is a no-op on existing
  banks and pre-v29 file snapshots load unchanged. Grounded in
  arXiv:2608.06953 (labelled-field stance survives compression +15pts,
  pre-registered replication); design doc
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-12-stance-span-gate-design.md`.
- **The measured stance prompts did NOT ship — the live extraction
  prompt remains v5.** The preregistered gates ran 2026-08-13 on the
  reproducible q8_0 bench server and split: the stance probe passed
  decisively (v8 stance capture 0.92, false-stance 0.00, and a headline
  side-finding: under v5 the extractor silently DROPS 70% of hedged
  facts — hedged-note recovery 0.30 vs 0.925 plain, repaired to 0.925
  by the stance rule; `evals/results/stance-probe-20260813-gate1.json`),
  and the extraction ladder passed saturated (all six runs across
  v5/v8/v9 × 2 replicates at gold_recoverable 1.0 / stale_leak 0.0;
  `evals/results/qwen-27b-sg-*.json`) — but the KU-oracle gate failed
  exactly the way the v7-events precedent predicted a same-call field
  addition could: v8 cortex 0.615 vs v5 control 0.731 (paired McNemar
  p=0.0117, net −9/78), v8 supersession churn 154→181, and v9 hybrid
  0.833 vs 0.897 (0 wins / 5 losses) against a rag control arm with
  ZERO cross-arm disagreements (empirical noise floor 0/78;
  `evals/results/longmemeval-ku-oracle-qwen-27b-sgku-{v5,v8,v9}.summary.json`,
  paired analysis `evals/results/stance-ku-paired-verdict.json`).
  Failure modes in the lost questions: stale values landing current,
  new abstentions, and one answer refused despite being IN the served
  current fact — a serving-side stance-makes-answerer-timid interaction
  the probe could not see. The stance plumbing ships dormant (nothing
  emits the field under v5 — the literal-gate v6 precedent); the
  measured prompt artifacts (`evals/prompts/ku_op_prompt_v8_stance.txt`,
  `ku_op_prompt_v9_stance_quote.txt`, construction-pinned by
  `tests/test_op_prompt_artifact.py`) stay committed as the baseline any
  future stance-prompt iteration must beat.
- **Provenance-span gate (`memory.dream.span_gate`, ships `off`)**:
  generalizes the literal-faithfulness gate (digit tokens only) to whole
  claims — the extractor emits a verbatim `quote` (≤200 chars) from the
  note it cites, and `span_unbacked` verifies normalized containment
  against THAT note (source scope is correct by construction for a
  quote; the literal gate's measured batch-vs-note false-drop classes do
  not apply). `log` counts and logs unbacked claims but writes them
  unchanged; `contend` parks unbacked scalar claims as visible
  contenders (`span:unbacked` provenance marker, resolvable via
  `memory_fact_resolve`) — never a silent drop, because span failures
  include benign paraphrase. Member ops are counted, not parked (no
  contender path for members); events are out of scope (own pass). Run
  counters `span_flagged` / `span_parked` land in the dream-run tallies.
  Boundary, restated from the two-man-rule spec: this checks
  fidelity-to-source, NOT trustworthiness-of-source — a poisoned note
  quotes itself perfectly, and `tests/test_span_quarantine_composition.py`
  pins that a perfect self-quote still parks under the quarantine.
  Default is `off` (not `log`) because the live v5 prompt emits no
  quotes — any other default would flag 100% of claims; flipping to
  `contend` requires the preregistered firing audit
  (`evals/results/span-gate-verdict.json`), not preference. Inspired by
  SodaMem's mandatory provenance spans (arXiv:2608.08055).
### Fixed (2026-08-12 — chronicle search no longer re-stems its own lexemes)
- **`chronicle_search` parses its rebuilt OR-query with the `simple`
  config instead of `english`**: the matcher stems the query once via
  `plainto_tsquery('english', ...)`, rebuilds AND as OR on the lexeme
  text, and previously fed that back through `to_tsquery('english', ...)`
  — which stemmed each lexeme a second time. Any query word whose stem is
  itself stemmable ('release' → 'releas' → 'relea') therefore silently
  matched no event description. Observed live 2026-08-12: "what happened
  on 2026-08-08 with the release?" could not serve the "published release
  0.13.0" event (tsvector holds 'releas'; the re-stemmed query asked for
  'relea') and only matched other events via the literal '2026' token.
  The `simple` config passes the already-stemmed lexemes through
  unmodified; ranking, ordering, and the ANY-term semantics are
  unchanged.
- **`memory.dream.chronicle` now defaults to `true`** and is surfaced as
  a Console knob (Dream group, live-mutable). The v28 events pipeline
  had already passed all four preregistered ev2 gates on 2026-08-05 (see
  that entry below and `evals/results/ev2-separate-pass-verdict.json`);
  the remaining question was production behavior, answered by the
  2026-08-05..08-12 live soak
  (`evals/results/chronicle-soak-review-20260812.json`): 188 events
  written, every row's description and date judged correct against
  independent records (0 incorrect dates, including historical
  backdating to June and April), 2 duplicate events both caught by the
  dedup guard, cadence continuous across two daemon recreations, and
  volume a negligible 160 kB for the week. The fallback sidecar is
  events-capable since the e4b-v3 multi-task bake
  (`evals/results/evlora-verdict.json`), so sidecar-only installs run
  the same pass; the soak's 20 sidecar-extracted events were judged
  separately (dates all correct; rougher phrasing). Independent field
  convergence: LeanMem (arXiv:2608.03463) lands on events as a distinct
  memory type with their own maintenance policy. Requires Postgres; an
  events-pass failure never stalls claims. Set `false` to opt out.
- **An explicit year-first date now counts as a temporal cue for event
  serving** (`has_date_cue`, a separate predicate so the gate-failed
  timeline channel stays untouched): the soak review found "what
  happened on 2026-08-08?" served no events because the cue regex only
  knows month *names*. Serving cap and ordering are unchanged.
- **`events_pass_failed` is persisted in the dream-run row's tallies**
  (previously only in the in-memory dream result): the soak review could
  not tally pass-failures for the week because container recreation had
  discarded the only record (the warning log).
- **Lesson-minted `<task> <aspect>` nodes no longer reach deep-dream link
  candidates** — `deep_dream` now applies the same `lesson_only_ids`
  exclusion `graph_review` has always used (via the candidate
  `excluded_ids` mechanism). They paired with the artifacts they mention
  and burned five top-k slots in one session.
- **The candidate support-overlap drop uses containment, not Jaccard**
  (`|shared| / min(|a|, |b|)` against the same
  `memory.deep_dream.max_support_overlap` knob): when the smaller side's
  mentions sit inside the other's, the similarity is co-mention, not
  independent evidence — one shared note pair generated ten cross-product
  candidates at Jaccard 0.67, all noise.
- **Lesson synthesis gates cross-key near-duplicates at write time**
  (`memory.lessons.synthesis_dedup_min_similarity`, default 0.88; 0
  disables): a synthesized lesson hitting an existing current lesson at a
  different key with the SAME polarity is skipped and counted as
  `deduped` — the store re-minted the same deploy/triage lessons at fresh
  keys every session (five folded on 2026-08-12 alone). Opposite-polarity
  near-matches are never gated (an "avoid" inversion of a "do" lesson is
  new information), same-key writes still supersede, explicit
  `lesson_write` callers are never gated, and a fully-deduped batch still
  consumes its signals (leaving them pending would bounce the same
  duplicates off the gate every sweep).

### Changed (2026-08-12 — /dream becomes a judgment session)
- **The `/dream` command (plugin + examples copy) is restructured around
  what automation cannot do.** With the auto-sweep extracting facts and
  the need-based tick applying the deep dream's mechanical half, the
  separate `deep` mode is gone: bare `/dream` now reads
  `memory_dream(action="status")` (including the `deep_dream` nudge),
  runs the mechanical pass only if the tick hasn't, and works the review
  queues — link candidates, merge proposals (group rule), junk, store
  curation. The old manual pull → extract → commit flow survives as an
  explicit fallback branch that fires ONLY when no extractor endpoint is
  configured or reachable — on such deployments the agent remains the
  sole cortex writer (tier 1). Guide and plugin README updated to match.

### Added (2026-08-12 — need-based deep-dream tick + harness-agnostic nudge flag)
- **The deep dream's MECHANICAL half now runs itself**: a need-based tick
  on the existing sweep timer runs `deep_dream(apply=True)` — rescore,
  guard-passing junk auto-delete, scope stamping, proposal filing, all
  snapshot-first — when the bank has grown by
  `memory.deep_dream.auto_min_new_entities` (default 150) since the last
  apply, or `auto_interval_days` (default 7) have passed. Step C
  (judgment) is never automated: the queues fill and wait for an agent or
  the Atlas. Every apply — manual or tick — stamps an id-watermark meta
  row (id-based, not count-based: merges and junk deletions shrink counts
  and would mask growth), so a manual pass resets the clock;
  `auto_tick: false` disables.
- **`dream_status` (and so `memory_dream(action="status")`) now carries a
  `deep_dream` block**: `{recommended, reason, new_entities, days_since,
  last_apply_at}` — a harness-agnostic "a consolidation pass is
  recommended" nudge ANY MCP client can read and surface to its user.
  Tool-result content is deliberately the only channel used: it is the
  one MCP signaling path reliably delivered across hosts.

### Changed (2026-08-12 — candidate slots stop leaking to settled work)
- **Deep-dream link candidates now exclude pairs that already have a
  PENDING link proposal, and pairs touching junk-flagged entities** — both
  applied inside `candidate_pairs` before top-k, because post-filtering
  would still let them consume slots. Measured on the 2026-08-12 round-2
  pass: already-proposed pairs re-occupied ~20 of 49 candidate slots and
  one junk-flagged compound entity held 6 more, crowding out genuinely new
  pairs. The merge-filing junk filter stays as a second layer.

### Added (2026-08-12 — review-queue Phase 2: grouping, junk-first routing, accept-rate)
- **Merge proposals sharing an endpoint carry a `group` key** (the shared
  entity's display) in both review payloads — the deep-dream
  `merge_proposals` enrichment and the `graph_review` merge-candidate
  finding the Atlas queue renders (shown as a `⛓` chip). The write-dedup
  detector files up to three matches per minted entity, so such rows are
  one where-does-this-entity-belong decision: the first accept deletes the
  shared entity. The `/dream deep` command and the deep-dream runbook now
  say so.
- **Junk-first routing**: neither filing site (write-dedup, deep-dream)
  proposes a merge whose side is junk-flagged — pending junk proposal or
  flagged in the same pass. The junk queue owns that node; a parallel
  merge proposal double-handled it (delete-vs-fold across two queues).
- **`merge_decision_stats`** in the `graph_review` payload (and an accept-
  rate line in the Atlas recent-merges panel): accepted/rejected tallies
  and accept rate over the durable `merge_decisions` audit, excluding
  `dream-auto` junk deletions. This is the detector-precision measure the
  2026-08-11 triage produced (38/153) and previously lost to the audit
  log; no schema change — computed from existing rows.

### Changed (2026-08-12 — merge-proposal precision: name-shape vetoes + live fold direction)
- **Merge-proposal filing (write-dedup and deep-dream) now applies two
  name-shape vetoes** (`graph_review.merge_veto`): `event-slug` (a broader
  name never folds into a date/run-tag-stamped event node; same-name-modulo-
  date pairs stay proposable) and `numeric-substitution` (differing
  numeric tokens with identical alpha stems, or the pre/post antonym pair,
  mark siblings, not duplicates — one-sided numeric extensions such as
  `v2.0.0` vs `v2` still propose). Both rules are gated by a replay of the
  2026-08-11 full-queue triage (153 human/agent-judged proposals,
  `tests/fixtures/merge_triage_replay_20260811.json`, sanitized): they
  suppress 12 of the 101 ground-truth rejections and **zero of the 38
  accepted merges** (`tests/test_merge_veto.py` pins both properties).
  A scope-disjoint veto was measured and deliberately not shipped: two
  accepted host merges had fully disjoint scopes — naming drift correlates
  with scope drift, so for merge pairs disjoint scopes are weak evidence.
- **Merge fold direction is re-derived from current evidence at review and
  accept time** (`_fold_direction`, shared by every surface that presents a
  pending merge — `_enrich_merge_proposals` for the deep-dream payload,
  `graph_review` for the Atlas/console/wiki Merge buttons — and by
  `graph_accept_entity_merge`, which applies it): the insert-time
  orientation goes stale as the graph grows — two live proposals filed
  2026-08-09 had their from-side reach degree 8 against a degree-0 target
  while pending. Shown and applied derive from the same rule; ties keep
  the stored direction, and a batch of accepts can legitimately flip a
  later pending pair between listing and click.

### Fixed (2026-08-11 — dream runs are single-flight)
- **`dream_run` now takes a non-blocking in-process guard for the whole
  pull → extract → commit cycle**: a second caller while a cycle is in
  flight returns `{"skipped": "dream_in_progress"}` immediately instead of
  pulling the same cursor window. Every live trigger (sweep, console, MCP
  tool, session-end) funnels into this path, and the extractor call runs
  outside the service lock — two triggers racing consumed the same window
  twice (observed live 2026-08-10, dream runs 68/69: absorbed by the dedup
  layers, but double extractor cost and a window for contested writes).
  The next sweep tick retries anything a skipped trigger would have
  consumed; the bench harness's sequential `dream_run` calls are unaffected.

### Fixed (2026-08-11 — session-key resume survives the idle reaper)
- **A session-key resume (`_resume_closed_session_locked`, shared by the
  SessionStart hook path and the store path) now records an activity touch
  for the reopened episode**, matching the handle path. The idle reaper
  proxies activity by band-entry timestamps, so a resumed session that then
  made only non-band-entry writes (outcome signals, cortex writes,
  surprise-gated restatement stores) was re-reaped on the very next sweep —
  firing an extra end-of-session dream per resume cycle. Benign in the
  common resume-then-store flow; systematic for outcome-only returns.
  Flagged by the 2026-08-11 independent review of the handle-resume fix.

### Fixed (2026-08-10 — episode handle survives the idle reaper; capture-policy briefing)
- **A write carrying a valid `episode=` handle to an idle-reaped root now
  resumes that episode** (within `PSEUDOLIFE_SESSION_RESUME_SECONDS`, the
  same window the session-key path already honours) instead of degrading
  with `episode_warning`. The SessionStart briefing advertises the handle
  as always-pass, but the idle reaper could close the episode mid-session
  and silently break the contract for the rest of the session — observed
  live 2026-08-10 during the alignment audit. A handle resume never moves
  the current-episode pointer (the writer may be a different session);
  ambiguous prefixes and past-window handles still warn-and-degrade.
- **The session briefing's CAPTURE section now warns against minting fact
  slots for repo-derivable values and against re-asserting slots without
  re-reading them first** (mirrored into `examples/CLAUDE.memory.md`, which
  is byte-pinned to the served block) — the two agent-side capture failures
  behind the 25-day-stale `version-published` fact and the contested-slot
  collision the same audit surfaced.

### Added (2026-08-10 — per-principal bearer tokens; tiers re-key to the principal)
- **`PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_TOKENS` (`token:principal,…`) maps bearer tokens to
  named principals** (spec
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-10-identity-rekeying-principal-tokens-design.md`).
  A matched token's principal becomes the writer id (outranking the
  client-asserted `X-PL-Writer`) and keys the toolset tier — the identity
  axis sanctioned by the MCP 2026-07-28 revision, which forbids
  per-connection `tools/list` variance and removes `Mcp-Session-Id`.
  The singular `PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_TOKEN` maps to the reserved principal
  `default` and keeps the legacy `X-PL-Writer`/`PSEUDOLIFE_WRITER_ID`
  writer path, so existing installs are unaffected. Malformed map entries
  fail closed (skipped tokens do not authenticate); either token form
  satisfies the non-loopback bind requirement; token comparison is
  constant-time.
- **Toolset tiers are principal-scoped** (`PrincipalTierState`, replacing
  the session-keyed `SessionTierState`): `memory_toolset` overrides apply
  per credential/writer, not per transport session — sessions sharing a
  token share a tier view, and the per-connection axis (dead under the
  stateless core, and connection-multiplexed even today) no longer
  participates. `PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_TIER_MAP` semantics are unchanged
  (principals share the writer-id namespace).
- **The SessionStart briefing now advertises the episode handle as
  always-pass** (`pass episode="…" on every memory write`) — identity
  tier 2, the concurrency-correct channel — instead of conditioning it on
  concurrent sessions.
- Post-review hardening (independent review pass, 2026-08-10): token
  comparison is byte-wise so a non-ASCII bearer (or token) answers 401
  instead of 500ing the gate; a `PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_TOKENS` that parses to
  zero entries with no singular token refuses startup rather than
  silently serving in open mode; token/token-map env plumbed into the
  compose daemon and documented in `ops/.env.example` (the feature was
  otherwise unreachable in the shipped deploy); token map parses with
  `rpartition` so tokens may contain `:`.

### Fixed (2026-08-09 — file-mode cortex snapshot round-trips temporal stamps)
- **`CortexStore.save()`/`load()` now persist the v11 temporal stamp
  (`tx_time`/`valid_time`/`hlc_phys`/`hlc_logical`/`writer_id`/
  `session_id`/`version`) and `freshness_class`.** The `.pt` snapshot —
  the persistence path when `MemoryService` runs without a storage
  backend (file mode) — omitted all eight fields, so every restart
  stripped every fact's stamp: records reloaded at HLC `(0,0)` in
  `_should_supersede` (any stale-HLC replay could silently supersede a
  standing fact) and freshness reset to evergreen — the same failure
  class the contender-stamps fix closed for the write path, reopened at
  reload. The Postgres path (`storage/sync.py`) already round-tripped
  these fields, so live PG-backed deployments were unaffected; this is
  correctness for file-mode users. Legacy snapshots load with the
  dataclass defaults (`None` / version 1 / evergreen). Pinned in
  `tests/test_cortex_snapshot_stamps.py`, including the
  stale-HLC-after-restart defense. No schema bump — file snapshot only.

### Fixed (2026-08-09 — contenders carry temporal stamps; promotion ticks the HLC)
- **A parked contender now carries its write's temporal stamps, and
  promotion is stamped as its own transaction.** Before this fix
  `write_fact` computed the v11 stamp (`hlc`/`tx_time`/`valid_time`) and
  the `freshness_class` for every write but dropped all four on the
  contend path, and `resolve(accept=true)` flipped the contender to
  `current` without stamping — so a promoted fact served with HLC
  `(0,0)` and default-evergreen freshness, and any later write replaying
  a *pre-promotion* HLC would silently supersede the explicit
  resolution (the same failure class as the 2026-07-02 `_promote_slots`
  fix). Now: parking preserves the write's stamps and freshness class; a
  contender-confirm advances `tx_time`/HLC like `_confirm` (never
  `valid_time`); and `resolve(accept=true)` stamps `tx_time` with the
  promotion time and takes a fresh HLC tick from the service — covering
  both the manual `memory_fact_resolve` path and the consolidation
  quarantine's automated second-witness promotions. `valid_time` is
  never moved: when a fact became true is not when it was accepted.
  All four `_contend` call sites are covered, including
  `add_member`'s aggregate-guard park (found by the pre-commit review
  pass). Pinned in `tests/test_contender_stamps.py` (9 tests, including
  the stale-HLC-replay defense). No schema change — the columns
  existed; the values were being dropped.

### Measured (2026-08-09 — consolidation quarantine: all three preregistered gates resolve)
- **Gate 1 (poisoning smoke)** is pinned deterministically in
  `tests/test_dream_quarantine.py`: same-tier agent-over-agent
  supersession parks, an independent second witness promotes, the same
  witness restating holds, empty-slot claims park currentless, parks
  and promotions journal and roll back. **Gate 2 (common-path
  non-inferiority)**: quarantine ON in the paranoid configuration is
  metric-identical to OFF on the e4b rung — gold 1.0 / stale_leak 0.1 /
  19 claims both arms, parked 0
  (`evals/results/quarantine-gate-qgate-0809.json`, producer
  `evals/quarantine_gate.py`; structural note in the artifact: the
  bench source carries no origin tier, so this run verifies the
  restructured claim loop, and firing behavior is pinned by the CPU
  tests). **Gate 3 (live friction)**: replaying the last 50 live
  dream-run journals, 0 of 629 scalar claims would have parked
  (`evals/results/quarantine-replay-qreplay-0809.json`, producer
  `evals/quarantine_replay.py`, 0 unresolvable rows) — zero production
  friction, with the honest coverage caveat that cuts the other way:
  the entries table persists no per-entry origin, so the v1 rule keys
  on source-derived origin (`claude`/`assistant`/`agent` source tags),
  and a bank whose writers use project-tag sources is outside its
  reach until a schema change persists origin per entry (a future,
  separately-preregistered decision).

### Added (2026-08-09 — consolidation quarantine: the two-man rule for low-trust dream claims)
- **`memory.dream.quarantine_low_trust`** (ships off; spec
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-09-consolidation-quarantine-design.md`,
  the MAFIA-informed hardening — defenses key on WHO wrote, never on
  what the text says). When on, a scalar dream claim whose backing entry
  is agent-tier and outside `memory.dream.trusted_sources` parks as a
  contender instead of taking `current` — including at a brand-new slot
  (currentless contender, a new `write_fact(force_contend=...)` path) —
  and promotes on exactly two routes: explicit
  `memory_fact_resolve(accept=true)`, or an independent second witness
  (a later matching claim from a different witness token — episode,
  else source — or a non-agent origin; the same witness restating
  confirms but never promotes) — tier-gated so the rule is never weaker
  than the provenance guard it reinforces: two agent witnesses cannot
  supersede a user-stated fact, and a claim corroborating the canonical
  value confirms without ever stamping quarantine provenance onto the
  current record. Automated promotions are stamped with a literal
  agent-tier support (never the claim's own origin field, which is
  model output), never as a user act; parks ride the existing
  `contested` journal rows and promotions journal under
  `quarantine_promoted`, both reversed by `memory_dream(rollback)`.
  Run results carry `quarantine_parked` / `quarantine_held` /
  `quarantine_promoted`. Honest scope, stated in `SECURITY.md`: a
  poisoned entry is still stored and retrievable — the quarantine
  denies it silent *canonical* authority; writer identity remains
  self-reported (mitigation, not authentication).

### Changed (2026-08-09 — set members are evergreen-only by decision; conversion drop is now audit-stamped)
- **The scalar→set conversion's freshness-class drop is a stated decision,
  not an accident, and no longer silent.** Set members remain outside the
  staleness machinery — deliberately: retraction on a set is the explicit
  `memory_set_remove` channel (decay would be a second, competing
  invalidation mechanism), no group-level staleness can honour the
  `stale_policy` fresh-payload no-harm contract, and per-member serving
  would re-rank deployed banks unmeasured (rationale documented in
  `docs/guide/memory-model.md`, "Conversion rules"). `_insert_member` now
  hardcodes `evergreen` (the parameter nothing could pass is gone), and
  converting a non-evergreen scalar stamps `dropped_freshness_class` on
  the conversion's supersession-log entry — the superseded scalar row
  keeps its own class for history. Serving payloads are unchanged
  everywhere (the set-slot no-harm pin in `tests/test_stale_policy.py`
  still holds byte-for-byte); the only new bytes are the audit stamp.

### Measured (2026-08-09 — H3: the staleness policy closes the answerer-discretion gap completely)
- **Quarantine wins on all four preregistered gates**
  (`evals/results/stale-policy-verdict.json`, producer
  `evals/analyze_stale_policy.py`, three replicate artifacts
  `retention-interval-stalepol-0809-r{1,2,3}.json` committed beside it;
  prereg `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-09-serving-side-staleness-design.md`).
  Against a flags-visible floor of 0.5/0.4/0.4 across replicates, BOTH
  policy arms drive the unqualified-stale-answer rate to 0.0 in every
  replicate (quarantine paired sign-flip p 0.0005, 13/30 discordant
  pairs all favoring the policy; demote identical at p 0.0005) — the
  version/quantity-shaped residual that sailed through the textual
  flags in ret-0809 does not survive the policy. No-harm holds
  structurally (fresh payloads byte-identical, gap 0.0), the
  quarantined value is recovered on explicit ask at rate 1.0 in every
  replicate (data moved, never lost), the evergreen control is
  untouched at 1.0, and the answered-other-fact confound diagnostic is
  0.0 everywhere — the win is compliance, not degradation. Per the
  preregistered fallback ladder the winner is `"quarantine"`; it ships
  selectable with the default unchanged (`"annotate"`) — flipping the
  default is a separate decision with its own soak, and demote's
  identical score is recorded as the less contract-invasive fallback.
  Honest scope: the eval measures the policy when staleness is served;
  production hit rates on stale facts remain unmeasured (ret-0809's
  caveat carries over).

### Added (2026-08-09 — serving-side staleness policy: `memory.search.stale_policy`)
- **Stale facts can now be demoted or value-quarantined at the daemon,
  not just annotated** (spec
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-09-serving-side-staleness-design.md`,
  implementing the ret-0809 finding that the answerer heeds staleness
  flags selectively, keyed on value shape). `memory.search.stale_policy`
  defaults to `"annotate"` (byte-identical to previous behavior);
  `"demote"` sorts stale records after non-stale ones on every list
  surface and adds a top-level `warning`; `"quarantine"` replaces a
  stale record's `value` with a wrapper and moves the original to
  `last_known_value` — data moved, never hidden. Applied inside the
  shared record serialisers, covering every scalar-record read surface
  (search, lookup, dump, contenders, the compact `memory_search` cortex
  block, and the compact `memory_world_search` projection). Deliberate
  exemptions, named: version history (the audit and recovery surface),
  `chain`/graph fact projections (machine-consumed summaries), and
  set-valued slots (members are structurally always evergreen, pinned by
  test). Non-stale records are byte-identical under every policy —
  asserted structurally in `tests/test_stale_policy.py` — and an
  unrecognised policy value degrades to `annotate`.

### Changed (2026-08-09 — the daemon pins the extractor prompt cache off, by measurement)
- **Every extractor the daemon builds now sends `cache_prompt: false`**
  (`memory.dream.extractor_cache_prompt`, default `false`; `null`
  restores the server default, `true` forces the cache on; non-llama.cpp
  endpoints ignore the field). This resolves the decision deliberately
  deferred in the warm-cache root-cause fix with the measurement it
  asked for: on the LIVE production sidecar the pin costs +7.25s per
  extraction call of shared-prefix prefill (3.41s → 10.65s over 4
  alternating pairs, producer `evals/sidecar_cache_probe.py`, artifact
  `evals/results/sidecar-cache-latency-sidecar-cache-0809.json`) —
  noise for a background sweep on a 600s interval with a 480s timeout
  budget, against the measured alternative of extraction output that
  depends on cache state (`warm-cache-probe-0809`). Takes effect on the
  next deploy.

### Fixed (2026-08-09 — warm-container ladder corruption root-caused: the llama-server prompt cache)
- **The evlora campaign's warm-container hazard is pinned to
  `cache_prompt` (the llama-server request default) and closed.** A
  warm extractor container answers byte-identical temperature-0
  requests differently once its prompt cache is populated: fresh pass
  19 claims / stale_leak 0.1, warm passes 26 claims / 0.2 on the
  current tree (`evals/results/e4b-v3-warmrep-*.json`); injecting
  `cache_prompt: false` on the *same warm server* restores the fresh
  output exactly, and reverting it restores the corruption
  (`evals/results/warm-cache-probe-0809.json`, producer
  `evals/warm_cache_probe.py`). Fix shipped in two layers:
  `OpenAICompatExtractor` gains an `extra_body` passthrough (default
  `None` — daemon behavior byte-identical) which the ladder pins to
  `cache_prompt: false`, verified end-to-end by a keep-warm two-pass
  replication now agreeing at the fresh baseline
  (`evals/results/ladder-replicate-warmfix-0809.json`); and
  **`evals/ladder_replicate.py`** makes fresh-container-per-pass the
  paved road for replication — it owns the container lifecycle,
  computes agreement over the deterministic metrics only, and refuses
  to average a disagreeing pass set. Open question flagged for a
  measured decision, not changed here: the *production* sidecar runs
  warm with the cache on, so live extraction output can depend on
  cache state — pinning it off in the daemon trades prefill latency
  for determinism and deserves its own timing measurement.

### Measured (2026-08-09 — retention-interval eval: serving is time-invariant; staleness flags work but are heeded selectively)
- **Both preregistered hypotheses resolve on the first run**
  (`evals/results/retention-interval-verdict.json`, producer
  `evals/analyze_retention.py`, tag `ret-0809`, all replicate artifacts
  committed beside it). **H1 confirmed exactly**: the ladder bank
  queried under five simulated clocks (0–365 days) returns identical
  metrics (gold 1.0, stale_leak 0.1) and one identical context hash —
  nothing in the serving path reads the clock, certifying supersession
  does not rot with age and pinning the regression guard for any future
  time-aware serving. **H2 passes decisively but incompletely**: with
  `effective_confidence`/`stale` visible, the answerer's
  unqualified-stale-answer rate halves (1.0 → 0.5/0.4/0.6 across three
  replicates; paired sign-flip p 0.0002, 30 pairs, every discordant
  pair favoring flags) at zero cost to fresh facts and zero base-rate
  hedging in the evergreen control. The residual is the finding: flag
  compliance is **fact-consistent, not random** — version- and
  quantity-shaped values (`deployed version 3.8.1`, `batch-size 500`)
  are asserted unqualified in every replicate despite visible flags,
  while other slots always hedge. Per the preregistered decision rule,
  ScrubJay-style auto-perishability stays shelved (class granularity is
  not the binding error); the measured next lever is a serving-side
  staleness policy, under its own preregistration.


### Added (2026-08-08 — retention-interval eval harness: the freshness machinery gets its first eval)
- **`evals/retention_interval_eval.py`** (preregistration
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-08-retention-interval-eval-design.md`):
  the first eval on the time-since-stored axis. Study A replays the
  ladder bank under simulated query clocks (0–365 days, injected at the
  freshness layer's single clock seam — no production knob) and
  preregisters exact-zero deltas plus identical context hashes; Study B
  seeds volatile/slow facts through the real write path, ages them past
  the volatile staleness horizon, and renders paired answerer arms that
  differ only in the `effective_confidence`/`stale` fields, against an
  evergreen no-decay control. Contexts-only smoke verified live: at +90
  simulated days volatile facts serve `stale: true` at the 0.4 decay
  floor, slow facts decay on-curve without the flag, evergreen controls
  are untouched. Judged scoring (reproducible bench server) runs under
  its own tag; results land with the verdict artifact.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-08 — reversible dreams, chronicle events, and the multi-task extractor

### Changed (2026-08-08 — default extractor sidecar bumps to the e4b-v3 multi-task fine-tune)
- **`ops/Dockerfile.extractor` bakes the v3 GGUF**
  (`pseudolife-extractor-e4b-v3-Q4_K_M.gguf`): one adapter now serves
  both the claims pass and the dated-events pass the chronicle uses,
  trained from Opus-5 teacher labels. Ship-gated by the evlora campaign
  below (every gating check green; `evals/results/evlora-verdict.json`
  records the two reported residuals — a stable one-pair ladder
  `stale_leak` and a noise-level KU letter miss — that the deploy
  decision weighed). The v2 GGUF stays published on the same HF repo
  for rollback via `--build-arg MODEL_URL`.

### Measured (2026-08-08 — e4b-v3 multi-task sidecar passes every gate; ship candidate)
- **The evlora campaign (PR #114 preregistration) completes with every
  gating check green and the ship rule met**
  (`evals/results/evlora-verdict.json`; Run T verdict and all compare
  artifacts committed beside it; tag `evlora-0807`). One multi-task
  QLoRA over both Opus-teacher datasets (1483 rows kept, 317 dropped
  over the 5120 shape; the events-dataset producer is
  `evals/distill_datagen_events.py`, committed with this entry) trains
  in 1.75 h and clears Run T: ladder gold
  1.0 vs 1.0; KU-oracle cortex 0.679 vs the deployed v2's 0.654 over
  five replicates each (judge std 0.0) — the claims regen *improves*
  claims — quantity smoke clean, and the capacity spot captures 14 of
  the 18 Opus-covered instances, nearly double its bar. Run B (500
  questions, 8 arms, the student as extractor for both passes): rag
  control exact zero; the primary — syn on the v3 bank vs the committed
  `evq-0806` syn on multi-session — lands +0.128 (p 0.0068, 27W/10L),
  read as a joint claims+events effect because the claims covariate
  (+0.056, p 0.0039) exceeds its attribution bound: the 4B student's
  claims bank now beats the qwen-27b bench extractor outright (hybrid
  0.714 vs 0.658). The new directive instruction arm passes no-harm and
  posts the series' best cells (0.764 pooled, 0.714
  temporal-reasoning) but misses its promotion bar (ms p 0.72); it
  stays bench-only. Honest residuals: ladder stale_leak 0.1 vs v2's
  0.0 (one pair, stable across three fresh-container replicates), and
  the KU guard misses its 0.02 letter by 0.006 (2 of 78 questions,
  p 0.74). Incidental harness finding: a warm llama.cpp candidate
  container corrupts subsequent ladder passes (stale_leak 1.0 on
  passes 2–3 vs 0.1 fresh) — all campaign numbers were
  fresh-container; ladder replication now restarts the container per
  pass. Deploy remains a user decision; chronicle stays default-off.

### Measured (2026-08-07 — evq residual decomposition: retrieval exonerated, extractor capacity is the gap)
- **The evq-0806 multi-session residual is decomposed offline — no GPU —
  by replaying `chronicle_search`'s exact matcher against the haystacks**
  (`evals/results/evq-residual-decomposition-0807.json`, Opus ceiling
  probe in `evals/results/evq-opus-probe-0807.json`). Of the 18 rows
  where rag is right and `hybrid_ev_syn` still wrong: 0 hit the
  30-event serving cap and every row's needed instance sentences pass
  the any-term matcher, so the preregistered next probe — retrieval
  matching — is measured dead before spending GPU on it. 14 rows are
  sub-cap with matchable instances absent from the bank: extraction
  side. The Opus ceiling probe (v2 prompt, instance-bearing sessions
  only) shows a strong extractor captures those instances with
  quantities verbatim where qwen-27b served 0–3 events across whole
  ~50-session haystacks — the gap is extractor capacity, not the
  prompt, and the measured fix is the events-pass sidecar LoRA on the
  banked Opus labels. The 3 primary-gate losses share one mechanism:
  block-authority — the answerer treats a fuller-but-still-partial
  events block as exhaustive (counting 4 model kits because 4 are
  listed); the hedged `hybrid_ev_hdr` header rescued none of them and
  flips zero multi-session rows, so the textual hedge is
  measured-insufficient and any anti-suppression fix moves to
  answerer-instruction or serving policy, under its own
  preregistration. State-shaped instances ("I'm currently on page
  250") remain outside events' reach by design and stay with the
  static-fact aggregation track.

### Measured (2026-08-07 — events quantity gates: the fix works row-for-row, the run stays under the bar)
- **The events quantity + coverage gate run is recorded as a
  mechanism-confirmed miss; nothing is promoted** (preregistration
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-events-quantity-coverage-design.md`;
  verdict `evals/results/evq-verdict.json`; 500 questions, 7 judged
  arms, tag `evq-0806`). The deterministic quantity smoke passed with
  every seeded quantity retained verbatim. Both validity gates came in
  exact: the rag control reproduced `aggserve-0806` at delta 0.000
  (0/0 flips), and claims-inertness — preregistered at the noise-floor
  bound after the exact-zero bar was retired — also measured exactly
  0.000 (0/0 flips). The primary (`hybrid_ev_syn` on the v2 events
  bank vs the committed `aggserve-0806` syn, multi-session n=133)
  missed: +0.038 (p 0.226, 8W/3L). The mechanism join is the finding:
  7 of the 8 win rows are exactly the audited residual rows the design
  targeted (3 cue-miss, 3 quantity-stripped, 1 extraction-gap — all
  amount-arithmetic), so the keep-quantities rule converts precisely
  the rows it was written for, at about half the audit's ~15-row
  ceiling, while three losses and n=133 noise keep the net +5 under
  p < 0.05. The new partial-record header arm is free (+0.002 pooled
  vs syn) and posts the run's best cells — 0.720 overall, 0.662
  temporal-reasoning; non-inferiority passed with the strong four at
  exactly zero flips (n=234) again. The multi-session ladder under the
  v2 bank — hybrid 0.376, +events 0.391, +widened serving 0.459,
  +tally 0.474, vs rag 0.504 — now recovers ~77% of the hybrid→rag
  gap, up from ~47% under v1. Per the preregistered fail branch the
  shipped events prompt stays v1 and the next probe is retrieval-side
  (`chronicle_search` matching on the still-unserved gap rows); the
  header arm's abstention-suppression win case waits for a BEAM
  re-run.

### Fixed (2026-08-06 — build-cache retention was a silent no-op under the containerd image store)
- **`ops/prune-build-cache.ps1` / `.sh` now pass `--all` on every
  `docker builder prune`.** Under Docker Desktop's containerd image store
  (engine 29.6.2, buildx 0.35), every non-`--all` prune form exits 0 and
  reclaims `Total: 0B` regardless of filters, so both the age pass and
  the ceiling pass had been no-ops since the scripts' introduction — the
  cache grew to 38.95GB against the 20GB ceiling while every retention
  run reported success. With `--all` the identical commands reclaimed
  ~20GB live (38.95GB -> 18.22GB, fstrim returning 20.4GiB to the vhdx
  free list) with live images untouched.
- **The ceiling pass re-measures and repeats (bounded at 5 passes)**
  instead of trusting a single prune: cache-record parent chains unwind
  one pass at a time and containerd's GC frees space asynchronously, so
  one pass can stop well above the target (38.95 -> 35.61 -> 20.37 ->
  18.22GB measured across passes). Only the under-ceiling exit is quiet:
  a no-progress pass (remainder pinned by live images) and an exhausted
  5-pass budget both warn — and still exit 0 rather than failing an
  otherwise-healthy deploy.

### Security (2026-08-06 — cryptography 50.0.0)
- **Bumped `cryptography` 49.0.0 → 50.0.0 in the daemon image lock**
  (CVE-2026-69247, high: Bleichenbacher oracle in PKCS#7 EnvelopedData
  decryption via distinguishable errors and timing). The daemon does not
  decrypt PKCS#7 payloads — the pin arrives transitively (pypdf/PyJWT/
  oauthlib optional extras) — so exposure was theoretical, but the lock
  now carries the patched release. Dependabot alert #11.

### Fixed (2026-08-06 — set history is deterministic under timestamp ties)
- **`memory_history` on a set-valued slot no longer depends on strict
  timestamp inequality for its ordering.** The version list is built
  member-by-member and re-ordered by a single timestamp sort, so two
  writes landing on the same clock value could let a member's removal
  sort ahead of a later member's add (surfaced as a one-off full-suite
  flake). Ties now break adds-before-removes, then by member insertion
  order — the only order the store can still attest to at equal clocks —
  and a frozen-clock regression test pins it.

### Added (2026-08-06 — events coverage audit: quantities are the bottleneck, not ordering)
- **The multi-session residual is now audited row-by-row against the
  source sessions** (`evals/results/events-coverage-audit-0806.json`;
  method and per-row quoted evidence inside). Of the 24 rag-right /
  syn-wrong rows, 19 are amount-arithmetic — they need numeric values
  combined across sessions, and the v1 events prompt strips those
  numbers at extraction ("completed my first full marathon in 4h 22min"
  served as "completed first full marathon"). Mechanism split: 7
  not-event-shaped (static facts, out of events' reach), 5 cue-miss,
  4 extraction-or-retrieval gaps, 4 quantity-stripped, 2 partial
  blocks, 2 answerer failures. The paired BEAM autopsy (same artifact)
  retires answer-time ordering synthesis: 0 of 23 served event_ordering
  rows failed by misordering correctly-served events, and 6 of 8
  regressions were abstention-suppression — a partial events block
  reads as exhaustive and the model stops using the rest of the
  context. Three changes land now, preregistered in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-events-quantity-coverage-design.md`
  with **all GPU gate runs held**:
  - `has_aggregation_cue` widens to `total <quantity-noun>`, `average`,
    and `the most` (the five audited cue-miss phrasings); bare "total"
    still does not fire.
  - `--ev-variants` gains a `hybrid_ev_hdr` arm — syn content under a
    partial-record header — targeting the abstention-suppression
    regressions.
  - `evals/prompts/events_pass_v2.txt` lands as an UNSHIPPED candidate
    (v1 + a keep-quantities/exhaustiveness rule; pinned by test to stay
    v1-plus-one-rule). The shipped extractor constant remains v1 until
    v2 passes its preregistered gate.

### Measured (2026-08-06 — aggregation-cued serving: monotone but underpowered; coverage is the bottleneck)
- **The aggregation-serving gate run is recorded as an honest negative
  with a measured cause** (preregistration
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-aggregation-serving-design.md`;
  verdict `evals/results/aggserve-verdict.json`; 500 questions, 6
  judged arms, tag `aggserve-0806`). The rag control reproduced the
  `ev2-sep-0804` baseline exactly (delta 0.000, 0/0 flips, contexts and
  responses byte-identical on all 500). The claims-inertness and
  reconstruction validity gates missed their exact-zero bars at −0.006
  and −0.004 via the same llama-server extraction-stream noise floor
  the BEAM run measured the same morning; the reconstruction check is
  nonetheless structurally exact — zero prefix-property violations over
  500 rows, so the within-run variant deltas are unconfounded. The
  primary (full-list + tally `hybrid_ev_syn` vs reconstructed
  `hybrid_ev` on multi-session, n=133) came in direction-consistent but
  underpowered: +0.038 (p 0.123, 6W/1L), with the decomposition
  attributing the effect to serving (+0.030, 4W/0L) over the tally
  line (+0.007). The multi-session ladder is monotone — hybrid 0.376,
  +events 0.398, +widened serving 0.429, +tally 0.436, vs rag 0.504 —
  and non-inferiority passed both halves, with the four strong types at
  exactly zero flips (n=234): serving up to 30 events on aggregation
  cues is measurably harmless where it doesn't help. The
  decision-relevant residual: of 24 multi-session rows where rag is
  right and syn still wrong, the events block is absent on 16, and
  widened serving reached only 44/133 rows against the ~95 predicted —
  the remaining gap is extraction-coverage-side. Next: a coverage audit
  of the events pass against a gold instance list, before any
  answerer-side work.

### Measured (2026-08-06 — BEAM chronicle re-run: honest negative on event ordering, temporal effect replicates)
- **The deferred BEAM gate run is recorded as an honest negative per its
  preregistered ship rule** (2026-08-06 amendment in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-04-separate-pass-events-design.md`;
  verdict `evals/results/beam-ev-verdict.json`). BEAM 100K, all 20
  chats / 400 questions, `--chronicle`, tag `beam100k-ev-0806`, float
  rubric metric. Gate 1 (rag control vs the committed 0802 baseline):
  delta exactly 0 over 400 questions, 0/0 flips — the reproducible-judge
  pipeline reproduces bit-identically four days apart. Gate 2
  (claims-inertness) missed its exact-zero bar at −0.002 (p 0.83,
  19W/18L): the claims bank rebuilt differently on ~11 of 20 chats.
  Forensics (in the verdict artifact) attribute this to
  request-stream-composition nondeterminism of the shared llama-server
  — 1/400 *rag* responses also changed under byte-identical inputs —
  not to any events→claims code path, which measured exactly zero flips
  over 500 LME questions the day before. Under the preregistration this
  demotes gates 3–4 to within-run exploratory readings: the primary
  event_ordering gate FAILED (−0.016, p 0.68) and not for lack of
  serving — events were present on 23/40 event_ordering rows and netted
  −0.63 rubric points there, so raw dated blocks don't solve BEAM event
  ordering and answer-time synthesis is the named next experiment.
  Non-inferiority passed nominally positive: +0.020 pooled over the 9
  remaining abilities (p 0.023), driven by temporal_reasoning
  0.4625 → 0.6188 (+0.156, served on 32/40 rows) — the LME
  temporal-reasoning effect replicating in direction and concentration
  on a second benchmark, held at exploratory status by the gate-2 rule.
  No docs claim changes; chronicle stays opt-in pending the live soak
  review.

### Added (2026-08-06 — aggregation-cued event serving: counting needs the whole list)
- **Chronicle events now also serve on aggregation cues** ("how many /
  how much / how often / what percentage / in total / total number /
  altogether / each time / every time" — `has_aggregation_cue`, a
  predicate deliberately separate from `_TEMPORAL_CUE_RE`, which also
  fires the gate-failed timeline channel and must not widen). On an
  aggregation-cued query the serve cap rises from 6 to 30 (a count over
  a capped prefix is wrong by construction) and the search result
  carries `events_total` — a computed property of the served list, not
  a claimed answer. Temporal-only queries are byte-identical to before
  (same gate, same limit-6 prefix under the same ordering). Motivation
  is the `ev2-sep-0804` multi-session autopsy: 116/133 multi-session
  questions are aggregation-cued and the old gate served events on only
  21 of them, while rag led hybrid_ev 0.517 to 0.405 exactly there.
  Dead code while `memory.dream.chronicle` is off (the default);
  preregistered gates in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-aggregation-serving-design.md`.

### Fixed (2026-08-05 — edge origin sticky by rank)
- **A dream re-assertion no longer downgrades a human-settled edge origin.**
  `upsert_edge`'s conflict clause took any non-null incoming origin verbatim,
  so the dream re-extracting an existing triple (`origin="agent"`) overwrote
  an edge blessed to `origin='user'` (`graph_bless_edge`) or confirmed as
  `origin='action'` (accepted review verdict) — after which the next apply's
  name-based `rescore_edges` recomputed its confidence and `dubious_edges`
  re-flagged the settled edge. Origin is now sticky by rank
  (user > action > agent): a lower-ranked re-assertion keeps the stored
  origin, upgrades and omitted-origin re-assertions behave as before.

### Measured (2026-08-05 — echo suppression is ladder-neutral; deployed)
- **The dream-write-path change in the review-autonomy work (echo
  suppression) re-ran the extraction ladder and is verdict-neutral.**
  Paired arms on the same reproducible Qwen-27B server, pre-merge master
  (`a6b9a7b7`) vs merged master (`b7934184`): `qwen-27b` rung
  gold_recoverable 1.0 / stale_leak 0.0 / 4.5 tokens-per-query on **both**
  arms; `floor` rung 0.1 / 0.1 / 3.4 on both arms. Artifacts:
  `evals/results/{floor,qwen-27b}-pr104-{pre,post}.json`. Deployed to the
  live daemon via `ops/update.ps1` (rollback tag
  `0.12.0-pre-dream-autonomy`); live verification exercised the new
  paths end-to-end — batch verdicts (`settled: 0` on stale ids), the
  `relate` verdict, and a full deep-dream apply that scope-stamped 192
  previously unattributed entities and filed 4 junk proposals, all
  correctly guard-kept.

### Changed (2026-08-05 — deep dream review autonomy)
- **The review queue no longer manufactures work a reviewer must undo.**
  Five mechanical fixes derived from the 2026-08-05 full-queue triage
  (~400 findings, ~85% settled mechanically):
  - *Junk auto-apply with a keep-guard*: `deep_dream(apply=true)` now
    deletes flagged junk entities that have no edges and at most the one
    fact slot they were minted from (the pre-apply graph snapshot is the
    undo; the node re-mints on next mention). Evidence-bearing junk stays
    a proposal. Each unattended deletion writes a durable
    `merge_decisions` audit row (`decided_by="dream-auto"`) — the
    proposal row CASCADEs away with the entity. Response gains
    `junk_deleted`.
  - *Mention-derived scope stamping*: the apply pass attributes
    still-unattributed entities from the sources of their mentioning
    entries (`memory.scopes` exclude/rollup respected) — the fact-keyed
    backfill never reached entities without a current fact, which had left
    327 entities projectless. Response gains `scoped`.
  - *Dream-echo suppression*: a fact write whose value is a strict
    compression of the slot's standing value now **confirms** the richer
    value instead of parking a contender — 4 of 7 contested slots in the
    audit were the dream re-asserting a terser copy of what the slot
    already said. Disqualified outright (conflict path preserved): any
    novel digit-bearing token, a negator on either side ("not deployed"
    -> "deployed" is an update, not an echo), or fewer than three tokens.
  - *Evidence-ranked fold direction for dream-alias proposals*:
    `_propose_dream_alias_candidates` now orders from/into by
    degree+fact evidence like the write-dedup detector, instead of filing
    (new, existing) verbatim — 29 proposals in the triage were real
    duplicates offered in the wrong direction, unactionable by accept.
  - *Accepted edges leave the dubious queue — and stay out*:
    `accept_link` floors the edge confidence at 0.7 (above the 0.6
    dubious threshold) and stores the edge as `origin="action"` (a
    confirming action), so neither `dubious_edges` nor the next apply's
    name-based `rescore_edges` (which recomputes every agent edge, e.g.
    related-to back to 0.45) undoes the verdict.
- **Slot-duplicate listings stop flagging deliberate structure.**
  Same-entity lesson/world pairs (aspect siblings: approach vs pitfall vs
  correction) are held to a 0.95 similarity floor instead of 0.80 — near-
  verbatim key-mint drift still lists; ordinary siblings (13 of 13 lesson
  listings in the audit) do not. Identifier-keyed sibling entities
  (`arxiv:X` vs `arxiv:Y`) are never listed: different identifiers are
  different referents by construction (15 of 20 world listings).
- **`memory_graph_review` grows the missing verdict and batch triage.**
  New `relate` action settles a related-not-duplicate pair (file vs the
  concept it implements, phase vs programme) by writing the typed edge and
  dismissing the pair in one call — previously only reachable through the
  console REST API. The five id-verdict actions accept `proposal_ids` for
  batch triage (the 2026-08-05 triage took ~470 single calls);
  JSON-stringified lists from MCP clients are coerced.

### Measured (2026-08-05 — separate-pass events pass all four preregistered gates)
- **The separate-pass chronicle design passes its full preregistered gate
  run** (500 questions, 4 judged arms, tag `ev2-sep-0804`; verdict in
  `evals/results/ev2-separate-pass-verdict.json`). Gate 1, rag control:
  delta 0.000, 0 flips over 500 questions vs the independent
  `aggp1-variants-0803` run. Gate 2, the claims-inertness tripwire this
  design exists to pass: the vanilla hybrid arm reproduces the
  `aggp1-variants-0803` hybrid at delta 0.000 with 0 flips over all 500
  questions — a fresh extraction with the events pass added leaves the
  claims bank verdict-for-verdict identical, eliminating the v7 inline
  design's -0.053 claims tax by construction and by measurement. Gate 3,
  weak-set primary (multi-session + temporal-reasoning, n=266): serving
  events lifts hybrid_ev over the same-run hybrid by +0.056 (p 0.00450,
  20 wins / 5 losses), concentrated where the design aimed —
  temporal-reasoning 0.534 to 0.624, multi-session 0.383 to 0.406.
  Gate 4, strong-set non-inferiority (n=234): delta 0.000 with 0 flips,
  despite events being served on 22 strong-set questions — harmless when
  present, not merely absent. `memory.dream.chronicle` remains
  default-off in this change; flipping the default is a separate,
  human-gated decision.

### Changed (2026-08-04 — extractor sidecar unloads its model when idle)
- **The in-stack extractor sidecar no longer holds its ~7 GB model resident
  while idle.** `ops/docker-compose.yml` now passes llama-server
  `--sleep-idle-seconds` (via a `command:` override; knob
  `PSEUDOLIFE_EXTRACTOR_SLEEP_IDLE_SECONDS`, default 300, `-1` restores
  always-resident): after the idle window the server unloads the model and
  drops to a few hundred MB — on shim installs the sidecar is only the
  *fallback* dreamer, so the weights were the box's largest steady-state
  resident in service of a rare failure path. Wake is transparent:
  `/health` answers 200 while sleeping (healthcheck holds, and doesn't keep
  it awake), and the next completion request blocks until the model
  reloads, comfortably inside `PSEUDOLIFE_DREAM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, so an
  unattended dream sweep that falls back mid-run waits instead of failing.
  First fallback dream after a long idle pays the reload (seconds on an
  SSD). Existing installs pick this up with a config-only recreate of the
  extractor container (`docker compose ... up -d --no-deps
  pseudolife-extractor`) — no rebuild. No ladder re-run: the extractor
  binary, model file, prompts, and sampling are all bit-identical; only the
  process's idle lifetime changes, and a reload maps the same weights.
  Compose/Dockerfile arg-list drift is pinned by
  `tests/test_extractor_idle_sleep.py`.

### Fixed (2026-08-04 — boot-window memory balloon: no model load before storage connects)
- **`MemoryService._ensure_init` no longer re-loads the embedding model on
  failed init retries.** While Postgres was in crash-recovery after machine
  boot (~3 minutes), every incoming API/MCP call retried the whole lazy init;
  the embedder was constructed *before* the storage connect, so each retry
  loaded a fresh ~2.4 GB Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B and then failed on the
  connect — 12 loads in the 2026-08-04 incident window ballooned the daemon
  to 21.2 GB RSS (31.5 GB cgroup peak) and nearly OOMed the host, with the
  dead copies stuck in torch module reference cycles. Storage now connects
  first (a down database costs a fast connect error, never a model load) and
  an embedder built by a partially-successful attempt is reused by the next
  attempt. Regression-pinned by `tests/test_init_retry_model_reuse.py`;
  reproduced pre-fix as a +2.35 GB/request RSS staircase against an
  unreachable-DB container.

### Added (2026-08-04 — Console Dreamer card: one-click dreamer model switching)
- **`memory.dream.extractor_model_override`** — a model-only override for
  the primary extractor, applied by `resolve_endpoints` *after*
  env-vs-config ownership resolution, so the dreamer model can be switched
  live without flipping `extractor_source` to `config` and re-owning the
  env-managed endpoint/fallback wiring. Primary only; the fallback
  sidecar's model is never overridden. `None` (default) is inert —
  resolution is byte-identical to before. `build_extractor` now delegates
  its env-vs-config resolution to `resolve_endpoints` (one authority for
  builder and status display — its private copy of the logic is exactly
  where the override initially failed to reach, caught by the watched-RED
  builder tests).
- **Console "Dreamer" hero card** (top of the Console tab) — shows the
  *effective* extractor resolution (primary/fallback endpoint → model,
  probe health, last-dream selection, settings owner; `dream_status` now
  carries `primary_model` / `fallback_model` / `extractor_source` /
  `model_override`) and a one-click model picker (Opus 5 / Sonnet 5 /
  Haiku 4.5 / Fable 5, custom `claude-*` names, or endpoint default)
  writing the override knob. The Claude CLI shim honours `claude-*` names
  per request (2026-08-02), so the switch takes effect on the next dream
  with no restarts; `evals/claude_shim.py` adds `claude-fable-5` to its
  `/v1/models` listing. Follow-up: a launch-default alias (`extractor` /
  `bench`) as the effective primary model is resolved to the endpoint's
  concrete model via its `/v1/models` listing (`primary_model_served` in
  `dream_status`, 300s TTL cache, failure = display degradation only), so
  the card reads `→ claude-opus-5` instead of `→ extractor` on stock
  shim deploys.
- **Installer dreamer-model choice** — `ops/install.ps1` / `ops/install.sh`
  now prompt for the shim's launch model on Claude-shim installs
  (`-Model` / `--model` non-interactively; default and recommendation stay
  `claude-opus-5` per `evals/results/dreamer-choice-verdict.json`) and
  forward it to the autostart scripts. `ops/install-shim-autostart.sh`
  gains `--model` — and now launches `evals/claude_shim.py`: it still
  pointed at the removed `sonnet_shim.py` path, so the systemd unit it
  wrote could never start.
- **Console knob gap-fill** — config fields added since July now have
  Console knobs: `dream.literal_gate`/`literal_gate_scope`,
  `dream.min_relation_confidence`, `dream.relation_quarantine_below`,
  `dream.retype_quarantined_max`, `dream.runs_keep`,
  `bm25.cortex_enabled`, `reranker.skip_margin`, and the
  `lessons.synthesize_in_dream`/`infer_outcomes`/`infer_outcomes_max_signals`
  trio (all live, defaults unchanged). Gated-off capabilities
  (`dream.chronicle`, `dream.known_facts_window`, the agg-recall search
  knobs) deliberately stay out of the registry until their preregistered
  gates pass, pinned by `tests/test_console_knob_gapfill.py`.

### Added (2026-08-04 — separate-pass event extraction: chronicle without the claims tax)
- **The dream's chronicle events now come from their own extractor
  call** (`OpenAICompatExtractor.extract_events`, events-only prompt
  pinned to `evals/prompts/events_pass_v1.txt`) instead of riding the
  claims call — the v7 combined prompt measurably cost claim quality
  (-0.053, p 0.011) and never shipped; with the separate pass the claims
  call runs the shipped v5 prompt byte-identically, so interference is
  zero by construction (and is measured as an exact-zero cross-run
  tripwire in the preregistered gate). An events-pass failure is
  non-fatal by design: claims commit, the cursor advances,
  `events_pass_failed: true` is reported, and the batch's events are not
  retried — an additive enrichment layer must never stall consolidation.
  Event writes reuse the existing gated/journaled chronicle path
  unchanged. `memory.dream.chronicle` still defaults off pending the
  gates (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-04-separate-pass-events-design.md`).

### Added (2026-08-04 — chronicle events: dated occurrences as first-class records (schema v28))
- **`chronicle_events`** — the dream pass can now extract *occurrences*
  ("adopted the kitten on May 13") beside current-state facts, the record
  type Phase 1's controlled negative showed was missing from the bank
  entirely. Bi-temporal by design: `occurred_at` (event time, nullable —
  accepted only as an exact `YYYY-MM-DD` and only when the batch corpus
  actually carries date information, never fabricated) vs `recorded_at`
  (transaction time); undated events keep the source's verbatim
  `occurred_phrase` and sort behind dated rows. Additive-only:
  contradiction handling sets `invalidated_at`, never deletes; exact
  restatements dedup. Event descriptions pass the same literal gate as
  claims; every write journals into the v27 dream-run journal (kind
  `event`), so `memory_dream(action="rollback")` reverts them by exact-id
  delete. Temporally-cued `memory_search` calls serve matching live
  events as an `events` block, oldest first. Extraction ships **off**
  (`memory.dream.chronicle = false`) with the shipped prompt unchanged —
  the events-capable prompt is a new measured artifact
  (`evals/prompts/ku_op_prompt_v7_events.txt`, op-probe variant
  `v7-chronicle-events`) that only ships if the Phase 2 preregistered
  gates pass (op adoption + count-decoy hold, ladder conformance, LME
  weak-type gate; BEAM re-run deferred — see the design doc's 2026-08-04
  amendment).

### Measured (2026-08-04 — aggregation-aware recall Phase 1 fails its gates; defaults unchanged)
- **All four Phase 1 retrieval knobs fail their preregistered gates** on the
  500-question within-run variants run (tag `aggp1-variants-0803`; verdict
  and per-knob compare artifacts in
  `evals/results/agg-recall-phase1-verdict.json`). On the weak types the
  knobs target (multi-session + temporal-reasoning, n=266, paired
  permutation vs the same-run vanilla hybrid): contiguity delta -0.147
  (p 0.00000), timeline -0.011 (p 0.70120), enum rendering -0.071
  (p 0.00030), all-three-combined -0.177 (p 0.00000). Timeline also
  regresses the strong non-inferiority set (-0.038, p 0.00340, 0 wins /
  9 losses). Every knob stays default-off — production behavior is
  unchanged. Validity: the cross-run rag control against `alltypes-0803`
  is exactly zero (0 flips over 500 questions), and all four vanilla arms
  reproduce that independent run exactly despite a fresh extraction. The
  controlled negative supports the design doc's Phase 2 hypothesis: the
  weak-type answer material is never extracted into the bank, so no
  retrieval-side change can surface it — events need to be stored as
  first-class records.
- **`evals/longmemeval_bench.py --variants`** builds five hybrid context
  variants per question from the same live service (vanilla, +contiguity,
  +timeline, +enumerated facts, all three), each answered and judged in
  the same row — one extraction pass instead of four (the design doc's
  bank-reuse assumption was wrong: `dump_bank` persists cortex facts
  only, no band entries; documented in the spec's 2026-08-03 Amendment).
  `answer_and_judge` and `report` handle arbitrary context arms;
  `evals/compare_arms.py` gains `--types` (per-type gate subsets) and
  `--arm-a/--arm-b` (cross-arm within-run pairing).

### Added (2026-08-03 — aggregation-aware recall, Phase 1)
- **Three retrieval-side knobs targeting the cross-session
  aggregation/ordering weakness** the 2026-08-03 BEAM 100K + LongMemEval
  all-types runs exposed (per the preregistration in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-03-aggregation-aware-recall-design.md`;
  all default OFF until their gates pass):
  `memory.search.contiguity_neighbors` — each search hit also surfaces its
  stream-adjacent neighbors (same episode, else same source), placed around
  the hit in (timestamp, seq) order and marked `via: "contiguity"`;
  `memory.search.timeline_channel` — temporally-cued queries get
  lexically-relevant entries injected beside the dense/slot/BM25 channels
  and the memory portion of the result ordered by stream position instead
  of score; and `--fact-render enum` on `evals/longmemeval_bench.py` —
  numbered, dated, one-per-line supersession chains and set members in the
  served fact context. Per-call overrides pin the eval harness's rag
  control arm to vanilla retrieval regardless of config, so the
  preregistered tripwire holds by construction.

### Fixed (2026-08-03 — shim autostart pointed at a nonexistent script)
- **`ops/install-shim-autostart.ps1` registered a logon task that could never
  start the shim**: a scripted rename edit had written literal BEL (0x07)
  bytes into the script path (`evals<BEL>nthropic_shim.py`) and the default
  log path — invisible in consoles, immune to substring greps. The paths now
  read `evals\claude_shim.py` and `~\.pseudolife-mcp\claude-shim.log`, and a
  new guard test bans stray C0 control bytes from every tracked text file so
  this class of corruption cannot land silently again.

### Added (2026-08-02 — LongMemEval beyond the knowledge-update slice)
- **`evals/longmemeval_bench.py` gains `--types`** (comma list or `all`;
  default `knowledge-update` with byte-identical artifact names): the other
  five LongMemEval question types add 422 questions for statistical power
  and LME-500 comparability. Non-KU rows use a generic judge variant that
  drops only the KU-specific update clause (abstention and equivalence
  clauses verbatim); rows without a `question_type` — every pre-extension
  artifact — re-judge byte-identically under the KU prompt. Extended runs
  get a type-slug artifact prefix and a per-type summary breakdown.

### Added (2026-08-02 — switch the dreamer model from the Console)
- **The Claude CLI shim honors a per-request `claude-*` model**, so the
  Console's existing Extractor panel becomes a live dreamer-model switcher:
  set settings source = config, endpoint = the shim, and pick
  `claude-opus-5` / `claude-sonnet-5` / `claude-haiku-4-5` in the model
  field — the next dream uses it, no restarts. Alias model names (the
  compose default `extractor`, `bench`) keep the shim's launch model, so
  existing env-driven deploys are unaffected. Knob suggestions updated
  accordingly.

### Changed (2026-08-02 — literal gate enforces by default; the CLI shim is model-agnostic)
- **`memory.dream.literal_gate` default is now `"enforce"`** — unbacked
  digit literals in dream claims are dropped, not just counted. Decided by
  the post-matcher probe re-runs (`evals/results/gate-firing-normfix-verdict.json`):
  remaining flags are dominated by genuinely unbacked literals (derived
  aggregates, imported world knowledge) at 1.3–1.7% of gateable claims.
  `"log"` restores the old observe-only behavior.
- **`evals/sonnet_shim.py` is now `evals/claude_shim.py`** — it has
  served any Claude model via `--model` since 2026-07-26, and the deployed
  extractor is no longer Sonnet. `ops/install-shim-autostart.ps1` gains a
  `-Model` parameter (default `claude-opus-5`, per the same-harness
  dreamer comparison in `evals/results/dreamer-choice-verdict.json`:
  cortex 0.885 vs 0.821, 5/0 paired), registers the task as
  "Pseudolife Claude Shim", and cleans up the legacy task name.

### Changed (2026-08-02 — literal gate learns the extractors' re-formattings)
- **The literal-faithfulness matcher now normalizes the three
  legitimate-reformatting classes the at-scale firing probe surfaced**
  (`evals/results/gate-firing-verdict.json`: 15 of 17 batch-scope flags
  were normalization gaps): spelled corpus numbers back digit tokens,
  hyphenated ranges/unit compounds gate per digit part, `N+` minimums
  match their base number, and `~`-marked approximations are exempt like
  dates. Fabricated-number detection is unchanged — a range with one
  unbacked endpoint still flags that endpoint.

### Added (2026-08-01 — every dream pass is now an auditable, reversible run (schema v27))
- **Schema v27: `dream_runs` + `dream_run_slots` — each dream pass that
  produces claims records a run row (cursor movement, tallies, lifecycle
  status `running|committed|failed|rolled_back`) and a per-claim
  pre-image journal of what every touched slot held before the write.**
  The journal lives outside the facts supersession chain on purpose:
  superseded-row compaction purges that chain in steady state, so it was
  never durable enough to revert from. `memory_dream(action="runs")` lists
  recent passes; `memory_dream(action="rollback")` reverts the latest
  committed pass by replaying its journal in reverse through the normal
  write paths (supersede-back — nothing is deleted; a reverted insert is
  retired via the new `CortexStore.retire_current`). Rollback keeps
  source traces and does not rewind the dream cursor (design doc:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-01-dream-run-journal-design.md`).
  Journal retention is newest-N runs (`memory.dream.runs_keep`, default
  50), pruned during the sweep beside superseded-row compaction.
  `memory_history` gains `as_of` (ISO or epoch) for point-in-time reads of
  a slot's version chain, with the compaction-window limitation documented
  at the tool.

### Added (2026-08-01 — literal-faithfulness gate ships; the verbatim-literals prompt is held on measured grounds)
- **Dream claims now pass a deterministic literal-faithfulness gate**
  (`memory.dream.literal_gate`, default `log`): digit-bearing tokens in a
  claim's value (outside date-like spans, which are exempt by design) must
  appear in the source notes — fabricated numbers/identifiers are counted
  (`log`) or dropped (`enforce`, opt-in). The corpus is the whole pull's
  note union by default (`literal_gate_scope = "batch"`): derived sums and
  cross-note values are measured false-drop classes under per-note gating
  (c2op-count-verdict qid 01493427). Counters surface as
  `literal_flagged` / `literal_dropped` in dream results. `enforce` stays
  opt-in deliberately: across every measured arm the gate never fired
  (the extractors fabricate no gateable literals on the bench corpora),
  so its safety where it *does* fire is unmeasured
  (`evals/results/literal-fidelity-verdict.json`).
- **The KEEP-LITERALS-VERBATIM prompt block (v6) does NOT ship** — the
  pre-registered KU gate failed: cascade -0.090 (p = 0.037), 1 win /
  8 losses against the shipped v5 arm with the rag control at delta 0.000
  exactly, and the digit-gold class it was meant to protect regressed
  0.949 -> 0.872 (n = 39). In 7 of 8 cascade losses a previously-correct
  cortex answer went wrong — general extraction degradation, the count-
  block lesson repeated. `evals/prompts/ku_op_prompt_v6.txt` stays
  committed as a measured, pinned, unshipped variant
  (`test_op_prompt_artifact.py`); the shipped `_SYSTEM_PROMPT` remains
  byte-pinned to v5. Full chain + per-qid mechanism breakdown:
  `evals/results/literal-fidelity-verdict.json`,
  `evals/results/compare-c2v6-literal-pairs.json`.
- **`evals/compare_arms.py`** — committed producer for the
  `compare-*-pairs.json` paired-permutation artifacts (all four arms incl.
  the derived cascade, win/loss qids, seed-deterministic; refuses to
  overwrite). The earlier pairs artifacts had no committed producer.
  `ladder_sweep.py` gains `--literal-gate off|log|enforce` and records the
  gate counters in rung artifacts.

### Changed (2026-08-01 — the extractor op prompt ships: hold reversed on measured grounds)
- **The shipped extraction prompt (`dream.py::_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) now solicits
  claim-level `op` for set membership, paired with the counts-are-never-
  members rule** — the option-B hold (2026-07-31) is reversed by maintainer
  decision on the strength of the count-exclusion gate: cascade exactly at
  the op-less control (delta 0.0, p = 1.0), count-class damage reversed,
  sidecar adoption and ladder-rung gates identical
  (`evals/results/c2op-count-verdict.json`). The prompt is byte-pinned to
  the measured artifact (`evals/prompts/ku_op_prompt_v5.txt`,
  `test_op_prompt_artifact.py`) so what runs is exactly what was measured;
  `op_probe`'s variant constructions re-anchor on the committed op-less
  control file so every historical gate artifact stays byte-identical to
  what its gate ran. Both Sonnet extractor mirrors
  (`sonnet_extractor_v1.md` / `v2.md`) regain the membership block from the
  pre-hold state plus the count-exclusion rule in the same style. Dreams
  can now form set-valued slots from conversation; the aggregate-conversion
  guard remains the apply-time backstop for any `op:"add"` landing on a
  stated total.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-01 — set-valued memory, and the measurements that earned it

### Fixed (2026-08-01 — YAML loader ran the surprise gate at 0.3 when the key was omitted)
- **A `config.yaml` with a `memory:` block but no `surprise_threshold` key
  silently ran the store gate at 0.3 instead of the documented (and
  dataclass-default) permissive 0.0** — the loader's hand-rolled fallback
  literal had drifted from the dataclass. The fallback now mirrors the
  default, and a guard test pins every hand-rolled fallback in that block
  against the dataclass so the class of drift stays closed
  (`test_yaml_memory_block_omitted_keys_keep_dataclass_defaults`). Found
  during the 0.12.0 docs currency pass; deployments whose config file
  omits the key will store near-duplicate entries again (the documented
  behavior — the surprise gate remains available by setting the key).

### Added (2026-08-01 — count-exclusion op prompt: the reserve rule measured, and it works)
- **The reserve prompt rule named by the guard verdict — `op` never applies
  to counts/totals/quantities — was built and gated, and it repairs the op
  block's measured KU damage** (`evals/results/c2op-count-verdict.json`).
  The arm (`evals/prompts/ku_op_prompt_v5.txt`, byte-pinned to
  `op_probe.VARIANTS["v5-count-exclusion-claim-example"]`) appends the v0 op
  block plus a COUNTS-ARE-NEVER-MEMBERS rule with a single-claim worked
  example. On the KU-oracle e2e (78 questions, reproducible q8_0 server):
  cascade lands exactly at the op-less control (delta 0.0, p = 1.0) — the
  pre-registered ship condition — while cortex (+0.090) and hybrid (+0.077)
  sit nominally above control (n.s.); against the un-ruled op prompt the
  cascade recovers +0.141 at p = 0.004 over the un-ruled op prompt, cortex
  +0.154 (p = 0.008), hybrid +0.103 (p = 0.019). Count-class damage
  reverses (cortex digit-gold 24 → 32, control 31); 5 of the 7 frozen-total
  questions from the census (`evals/results/c2op-count-census.json`)
  recover their gold as a current scalar, and genuine sets still form
  (75 member facts across 22 banks; one bank holds the recovered count-25
  scalar alongside 9 legitimate to-watch members). Wording was selected by
  targeted 7-question extraction probes (`--qids`, below): v3's standalone
  example object induced multi-object JSON parse retries, v4's integrated
  example was parse-clean but recovered one fewer; v5 keeps the dedicated
  example rendered as a single claim object — 5/7 recovery, zero parse
  failures. **The op prompt block remains held in the shipped extractor**:
  this verdict makes v5 the shipping *candidate*, gated on validating rule
  adoption on the deployed small extractor (qwen-27b adoption does not
  prove the sidecar's) and on an explicit reversal of the option-B hold
  decision. One anomaly recorded for future bank comparisons: every
  op-block prompt variant extracts roughly half the current scalars of the
  op-less prompt (442–512 vs 1003) with no measured e2e cost.
- **`longmemeval_bench.py --qids`** runs a named comma-separated subset of
  questions (targeted extraction / bank forensics; composes with `--tag`),
  and **`evals/analyze_frozen_totals.py`** classifies an op run's losses by
  the frozen-total signature against a control run's banks — the CPU
  forecast that sized this arm before any GPU was spent
  (7 of 21 lost questions rule-recoverable, 0 gain-side questions at risk).

### Changed (2026-07-31 — aggregate conversion guard: `add_member` no longer overwrites a stated total)
- **`CortexStore.add_member` no longer converts a scalar slot to a set when
  the current scalar is a number-led aggregate value** (`_is_aggregate_value`:
  `"32"`, `"27 species"`, `"$1,500"`) — the member is instead parked as a
  contender via the existing `_contend` machinery (audit reason
  `"member_add_blocked_aggregate"`), and the scalar stays canonical. Prior
  behaviour destroyed the stated total on the first spurious membership op,
  which the gate verdict measured as a net-negative KU-oracle effect
  (`evals/results/c2op-gate-verdict.json`, full verdict cited below).
  `resolve(entity, attribute, accept=True)` remains the explicit human path
  to overwrite the total with the accumulated member value; `accept=False`
  leaves the total untouched. Non-aggregate scalars (e.g. `"road bike"`) are
  unaffected and still convert one-way to a set on the first `add_member`,
  as before. **Review fix:** an add whose value already equals the current
  scalar now confirms it (`action="confirmed"`, mirroring `write_fact`'s own
  confirm branch) instead of parking a contender identical to itself. The
  dream claim-apply loop's trace-write + reinforcement-bump block now also
  skips `action="contested"` results, the same way it already skips
  `member_invalid`/`member_capped` — a blocked add never populated the slot,
  so tracing it could silently suppress a later, legitimate scalar claim for
  the same slot and source entry via the `has_trace` guard. The skip is
  action-keyed, not guard-keyed: a plain weaker-tier scalar conflict (a
  dream claim landing "contested" via `write_fact`'s own tier guard, a path
  that predates this feature) also no longer writes a trace or reinforcement
  bump — a contested write never populated the slot either, so the trace it
  used to leave asserted a false provenance link and could suppress a later
  legitimate claim the same way. **Gate result (2026-08-01,
  `evals/results/c2op-guard-verdict.json`):** re-running the KU-oracle e2e
  with the op prompt restored and the guard active came back per-question
  identical to the guard-less op run on every arm (0/78 flips), leaving
  cascade still −0.141 at p = 0.006 vs the op-less control. The guard fired
  correctly (3 banks reshaped; the same-value confirm observed end-to-end)
  but conversion destruction turns out to be the visible wreckage, not the
  causal path: under the op prompt the extractor re-routes later count
  updates into member-adds, so the stated total freezes at its first value
  — a clean-but-stale scalar answers no better than a mangled one. The op
  prompt block therefore stays held per the pre-registered rule; the guard
  ships regardless, as bank hygiene and protection for live
  `memory_set_add` writes. The targeted fix for the measured mechanism is
  the reserve prompt rule (`op` never applies to counts/totals) — since
  built and gated, and it recovers the loss; see the count-exclusion entry
  above.

### Added (2026-07-31 — dream extractor claims carry an `op` for set membership)
- **A dream claim may now carry `"op": "add" | "remove"`** to target the
  set-member model instead of the scalar supersede path — a claim without
  `op` is bit-identical to today (`MemoryService.dream_run`'s claim-apply
  loop, `pseudolife_memory/service.py`). `op:"add"` routes through
  `svc.set_add`; `op:"remove"` through `svc.set_remove` (both own their own
  embedding + persistence, same as every other set-slot entry point).
  `member_invalid`/`member_capped` results are logged (info/warning
  respectively) and the dream continues. A scalar claim (no `op`) landing on
  a slot that already holds current members is dropped and logged at INFO
  (`"dropped scalar claim for set slot %s.%s"`, mirroring the existing
  auto-promote guard) rather than crashing the dream or silently overwriting
  the set. A malformed `op` value (anything but `"add"`/`"remove"`) degrades
  to the scalar path with a warning naming the value — never a hard failure
  mid-dream. The extraction prompt (`_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `dream.py`, and the
  `evals/prompts/sonnet_extractor_v1.md` / `v2.md` mirrors) gained a short
  "collection membership" instruction block with one add and one remove
  example, phrased to keep `op` off plain value updates (a new job, a moved
  city stay scalar supersedes). `svc.set_add` gained an optional
  `confidence: float = 0.7` keyword (forwarded to `add_member`, which
  already accepted it) so the dream `op:"add"` path threads a claim's
  confidence through exactly like its scalar sibling instead of silently
  discarding it. Fixed a review-caught bug (pre-fix, never deployed): the
  per-slot `has_trace` "already formed this slot" guard is keyed by
  `(slot, source entry)` with no member value, so it must gate scalar claims
  ONLY — applied unconditionally, a SECOND `op:"add"` for the same slot from
  the same source entry (two collection items named in one note) read as
  "already formed" and was silently dropped after the first member landed.
  A `member_invalid`/`member_capped` result now `continue`s before the
  trace-write + reinforcement-bump block (nothing was actually stored, so
  nothing should be traced — combined with the guard above, tracing a
  never-stored member could also mask a later legitimate add). A dropped
  scalar-on-set-slot claim now also increments `tally["dropped_set_slot"]`
  so `dream_run`'s result surfaces the count, not just the log line. Covered
  by seven cases in `tests/test_dream.py` (op-add lands a member, op-remove
  removes one, a no-op claim on a member-holding slot is dropped with the
  store unchanged and `dropped_set_slot` incremented, a malformed op falls
  back to scalar with a warning, two `op:"add"` claims sharing one source
  entry both land, `op:"add"` confidence reaches the stored member, and a
  `member_invalid` result skips the trace write). The full story, two
  corrections deep: (1) the C2 gate's "extractor never adopts op" root
  cause was wrong — the model emitted `op` correctly and `extract()`'s
  parse whitelist silently stripped it (fixed; pinned by
  `test_openai_extractor_carries_op_through_parse`; probes 7/7 adoption,
  `op-probe-q8-fixedparse.json`). (2) With the parse fixed and the block
  restored, the definitive paired gate — whose extraction-variance
  baseline came back per-question identical to the control, so every
  delta is attributable — showed the block's net effect is NEGATIVE on
  KU-oracle (cascade −0.141 at p = 0.006): the model applies `op:"add"`
  to stated-total/aggregate slots and the one-way scalar→set conversion
  destroys the total the answer needs; losses concentrate on set-forming
  questions while non-set questions improve. The block is therefore held
  again — the MCP set tools are the set writers. (The conversion guard was
  subsequently built and gated: it holds the bank shape but does not
  recover the lost totals — see the aggregate-conversion-guard entry
  above.) Evidence:
  `evals/results/c2op-gate-verdict.json`.

### Changed (2026-07-31 — set-valued slots surface as one entry per slot, not one per member)
- **`cortex_search` groups a set-valued slot's current members into a single
  entry** instead of surfacing each member as its own hit: `{"kind": "set",
  "entity", "attribute", "value": "m1; m2 (2 members)", "members": [...],
  "score": <max member score>, "contested": false}`. Grouping runs AFTER the
  BM25 fusion pass (fusion itself stays per-record) and always shows the
  slot's FULL current membership — score-descending for members that
  individually ranked, then any current member that didn't — not just
  whichever members cleared the caller's score floor. `evals/rebuild_contexts.py`'s
  `rebuild_fact_lines` composes the identical value string offline via the
  new shared `pseudolife_memory.memory.cortex.compose_set_value` helper;
  bank fact dicts gain an optional `"kind"` (`"member"` marks one row of a
  set — absent means scalar), so a bank dumped before this change rebuilds
  byte-identically (pinned against a committed fixture,
  `tests/fixtures/rebuild_fact_lines_legacy_bank.json.gz`). `evals/longmemeval_bench.py`'s
  `build_contexts` composes a set entry's line from its already-composed
  `value` and garnishes it with "former members" (removed members, oldest
  first) pulled from the set-shaped `history()`, mirroring the scalar
  "earlier values" idiom; the composition is factored into
  `_compose_fact_line` for offline unit testing
  (`tests/test_longmemeval_bench_fact_lines.py`). `_cortex_record_to_dict`
  now includes `"kind"` on every fact dict (`cortex_lookup`, `cortex_dump`,
  `cortex_search` scalar entries). A set entry also now carries
  `"last_confirmed"`, `"asserted_at"`, and `"age"` (all backed by the same
  anchor — max `tx_time or asserted_at` over current members, the same
  priority `_cortex_record_to_dict` uses for a scalar's `"age"`) so
  `mcp_server.py`'s cortex-first block has real dates to render instead of
  going blank for every set slot. Accepted v1 scope: a set entry carries no
  `"freshness_class"` at all (it renders `evergreen` — the class-resolution
  helpers default an absent class that way, same as any unclassified scalar),
  and the anchor backing `last_confirmed`/`asserted_at`/`age` only advances on
  add/confirm activity — `remove_member` stamps `superseded_at` on the
  removed row but never touches those three fields, so removing a member
  never moves the slot's displayed dates. Fixed a latent crash the new set-entry
  shape would otherwise have caused: `mcp_server.py`'s `memory_search` cortex-first
  block indexed a fact's `"confidence"` directly, which a grouped set entry
  doesn't carry — now `.get`. Fixed a review-caught bug in
  `_cortex_bm25_fuse` itself: it keyed its lexical pool by `record.key`
  (the SLOT identity) rather than the record, so every member of a set
  shared one BM25 score and the lexical-only-injection path could only
  ever inject one member per slot — now keyed by `id(record)`, genuinely
  per-record. `evals/lme_v2_smoke.py`'s `build_contexts_v2` hand-rolled the
  same fact-line loop `longmemeval_bench.build_contexts` used to have
  (mislabeling a set's current members as superseded "earlier values");
  routed through the shared `_compose_fact_line` instead. That helper also
  no longer lists a member as "former" in the removed-members garnish if a
  remove-then-re-add currently has it back in the set. Covered by
  `tests/test_cortex_sets.py` (grouping, score-ordering, unranked-member
  inclusion, no-entry-when-nothing-ranks, mixed scalar+set, last_confirmed),
  `tests/test_cortex_bm25.py::test_rebuild_fact_ranking_matches_service_fusion_set_slot`
  (a deliberately engineered order-divergence scenario, confirmed red
  against the pre-fix keying), `tests/test_lme_v2_smoke_fact_lines.py`,
  `tests/test_longmemeval_bench_fact_lines.py`'s remove-then-re-add cases,
  and `tests/test_cortex_fact_currency.py`'s set-slot case (the pre-existing
  currency guard's fixtures were scalar-only and structurally blind to
  whether a set entry carries a date at all).

### Added (2026-07-31 — MCP tools for set-valued cortex slots)
- **`memory_set_add` / `memory_set_remove`** expose the Task 2–4 member
  model on the MCP surface — add/confirm or retract one member of a
  set-valued `(entity, attribute)` slot (many concurrent values, e.g.
  tags, rather than one canonical NOW value). A scalar already at the slot
  converts to a set one-way the first time `memory_set_add` targets it;
  `memory_fact_set` against a slot already converted to a set now raises an
  actionable error naming these two tools instead of the store's own
  `add_member`/`remove_member` vocabulary. Both are minimal tier, alongside
  `memory_fact_set`. Reads still go through `memory_fact_get`, which now
  returns `{kind: "set", members, removed}` for a set slot and treats
  `members: []` (every member removed) as empty — same as a scalar miss —
  rather than as a found record. Covered by `tests/test_mcp_server.py` and
  the Postgres persistence leg in
  `tests/test_cortex_sets.py::test_set_add_remove_survive_pg_hydration_through_the_service`.

### Added (2026-07-30 — cortex slots can hold a set: member-per-record add/remove lifecycle)
- **A cortex `(entity, attribute)` slot can now hold either one scalar value
  (unchanged) or a set of concurrently-current members** —
  `CortexStore.add_member` / `remove_member` / `members` / `slot_kind`
  (`pseudolife_memory/memory/cortex.py`), the mechanics the rest of this
  branch (the MCP tools, the dream `op` field, one-entry-per-slot serving —
  see the entries above and below) is built on. Reuses the scalar
  supersession spine rather than a parallel storage model: a member is a
  `CortexRecord` with `kind="member"` whose `status` cycles `current` ->
  `removed` exactly like a scalar's `current` -> `superseded`, nothing is
  ever hard-deleted, and every add/remove is logged to the same
  `supersession_log` the scalar path writes to.
  - **Add/confirm, never contest.** Unlike `write_fact`, members have no
    provenance-tier dispute path — there is no such thing as a "contested"
    member. A value that dedups (exact normalised match, or cosine >=
    `MEMBER_DEDUP_COSINE` (0.9) against a current member) confirms the
    existing member (bumps `last_confirmed` and, if higher, confidence)
    instead of duplicating; anything else inserts a new current member, up to
    `MAX_CURRENT_MEMBERS` (100) — beyond the cap, further adds are dropped
    (`"member_capped"`) rather than queued or silently applied. A value that
    normalises to empty is rejected outright (`"member_invalid"`): Postgres
    unique indexes treat NULLs as distinct, so an empty-normalised member row
    would silently bypass the per-slot uniqueness constraint on persistence.
  - **Conversion is one-way in both directions of the story.** A scalar
    already at a slot converts to a set the first time `add_member` targets
    it — the scalar row is superseded (kept as audit history) and
    re-inserted as the slot's first member; there is no path back to scalar
    while any member is current. Once every member has been removed, the
    slot holds no current record of either kind, so `write_fact`'s own guard
    (which checks for CURRENT members only) lets a fresh scalar land there —
    the slot "reverts" to scalar life as a byproduct of removing the last
    member, not a dedicated revert call, and the removed member rows stay as
    audit (`members(..., include_removed=True)`), just no longer reflected in
    `slot_kind`.
  - **The v19 duplicate-healing pass on daemon start is now scoped to
    `kind = 'scalar'`** (`pseudolife_memory/storage/schema.py`,
    `ensure_schema`). The pre-existing healing UPDATE (schema v19) partitions
    `facts` rows by `(entity_norm, attribute_norm)` and demotes all but the
    newest `current` row to `superseded`, run unconditionally on every daemon
    start; without the added `AND kind = 'scalar'` predicate it would
    partition member rows the same way and silently demote all but the
    newest member on a slot to `superseded` on every restart.
    `world_facts`/`lessons` healing and the `facts/contested` pass are
    untouched — neither has a `kind` column or a member concept. TDD-verified
    against the pre-fix loop:
    `tests/test_schema_v26.py::test_ensure_schema_healing_is_kind_aware` seeds
    two current `kind='member'` rows on one slot alongside a genuine
    duplicate current `kind='scalar'` pair on another, confirms one member
    was wrongly demoted pre-fix, and both survive post-fix while the scalar
    duplicate still heals to exactly one current row.
  - `slot.polarity` is accepted and preserved verbatim on an added/converted
    member in v1 — it is NOT interpreted. A negated add does not implicitly
    route to `remove_member`; a caller that means "no longer" calls
    `remove_member` itself.
  - Covered by `tests/test_cortex_sets.py` (add, confirm-by-norm,
    confirm-by-cosine, cap, invalid-value rejection, one-way scalar
    conversion, all-removed reverts to scalar, polarity passthrough) and
    `tests/test_schema_v26.py`.

### Changed (2026-07-30 — schema v26: set-valued cortex slots, columns + index split)
- **`facts.kind` (`scalar` | `member`, default `scalar`) and `facts.value_norm`
  columns added**, and the per-slot current-uniqueness constraint splits by
  kind: `facts_slot_current_scalar_uq` (`entity_norm`, `attribute_norm`) keeps
  the existing one-live-row-per-slot invariant for scalar facts,
  `facts_member_current_uq` (`entity_norm`, `attribute_norm`, `value_norm`)
  allows several members to be concurrently current on the same slot. The
  old unscoped `facts_slot_current_uq` index is dropped. Additive/idempotent
  migration; every existing fact defaults to `kind='scalar'` and continues
  to dedupe exactly as before — internal groundwork for set-valued cortex
  slots, no reader/writer behavior change in this change.

### Added (2026-07-30 — cortex fact retrieval gains an opt-in BM25 lexical channel)
- **`cortex_search` can now fuse a BM25 lexical pool with dense cosine** —
  per-call `bm25=True` or `memory.bm25.cortex_enabled = true` — mirroring
  the turn pool's fusion exactly over each current fact's composed
  `entity — attribute: value` text, with lexical hits gated by the
  normalised `bm25.min_score` rather than the caller's dense floor. It
  ships **off**, and the reason is a measurement, not a mood: the
  pre-registered `_s` A/B (`evals/results/bm25-ab-confirmation.json`,
  same banks rebuilt dense-only vs fused, reproducible q8_0 server, rag
  arm byte-identical across arms as control) found the fusion changed
  56/78 served fact contexts with **zero movement** in cortex accuracy
  (0.1795 both), cascade (0.4231 both) or commit rate (16 → 15), while
  the oracle regression-gate slice paid ~1 question (cortex
  0.6923 → 0.6795). Lexical gaps in fact retrieval are real; answer-level
  failures trace to fact coverage, so the default stays honest.
  Covered by `tests/test_cortex_bm25.py`.
- **`evals/rebuild_contexts.py` is now in ranking lockstep with the
  service** (`--bm25` opt-in flag). The first regression-gate run of the
  channel exposed why: the rebuild had its own dense-only ranking, so the
  gate "passed" code it never executed — the cortex arm came back
  byte-identical to baseline. The fusion now lives in both paths and
  `test_rebuild_fact_ranking_matches_service_fusion` pins them together;
  a fusion change that lands in only one place goes red.

### Changed (2026-07-30 — front door re-based to the end-to-end run; cascade published)
> **RETIRED 2026-08-25 (#188): the cascade 0.936 headline and the
> full-haystack confirmation below are no longer published claims.** The
> 2026-08-17 bench-instrument migration scores the same 78 questions at
> cascade 0.846 against an unchanged 0.859 control; the `_s` confirmation
> has never been re-judged. See the `[Unreleased]` re-framing entry at the
> top of this file.
- **The README benchmark table now shows the fresh end-to-end measurement**
  (`ceiling-e2e`: fresh qwen-27b extraction under the v25 backbone, BM25-on
  turn retrieval, reproducible q8_0 serving, 3 byte-identical replicates) —
  rag 0.859 / cortex 0.667 / hybrid 0.833 / **cascade 0.936** — replacing
  the held-fixed `ceiling-v25` table, which stays in the benchmarks guide
  with its narrative re-scoped: the concatenation hybrid's "~10 points over
  naive RAG" does not survive the v25 retrieval upgrade end to end, and is
  marked retired as a headline at that site. The published posture is now
  the **commit-gated cascade**, with its pre-registered full-haystack
  confirmation (cascade 0.462 vs rag 0.346, paired permutation p = 0.011,
  commit precision 0.714) published alongside. All ten evidence artifacts
  are committed in the same change (`ceiling-e2e` jsonl/summary ×3 + agg,
  `casc-q8` jsonl/summary, `casc-q8-confirmation.json`) and pinned by new
  rows in `tests/test_eval_evidence.py`; the honest limits — the vs-hybrid
  margin on `_s` is directional only (p = 0.18), and the 14/78 commit rate
  is the open retrieval workstream — are stated in the guide next to the
  claim.

### Removed (2026-07-30 — dead-code sweep, verified zero production call sites)

Every item below was confirmed unreachable before deletion: a whole-tree grep
per symbol (code, tests, evals, ops, docs, and the console's static JS), on top
of the mechanical pass that surfaced it. Nothing here changes behaviour except
the three REST endpoints, which had no caller in the console or anywhere else.

- **Three unused REST endpoints, `pseudolife_memory/web/routes.py`.**
  `GET /api/health` (a duplicate of the top-level `/health` liveness probe in
  `web/api.py`; the same `_health()` payload still rides inside
  `/api/overview`), `GET /api/tags`, and `GET /api/facts/contenders`. No
  reference in `pseudolife_memory/web/static/`, no test, no ops script — the
  console reads tags via `/api/overview` and contenders via the
  `memory_fact_get` MCP tool. The service methods behind two of them stay
  (`list_tags` backs `/api/overview`; `cortex_contenders` backs
  `mcp_server.py`); only the route registrations are gone.
- **`pseudolife_memory/utils/chunking.py` deleted** — `sliding_window_chunks`
  / `sentence_chunks` / `TextChunk` had no importer anywhere. The chunker the
  reference bank actually uses is `reference_bank._chunk_text`;
  `ReferenceConfig.chunk_size` / `chunk_overlap` feed *that* and are untouched.
- **`ContextBuilder` + `SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` and their private helpers
  removed from `memory/context_builder.py`** (with the `memory/__init__.py`
  re-export that was their only reference). Desktop-app legacy: the MCP server
  returns raw entries and the client builds its own context. `_relative_time`
  survives — `service.py` stamps cortex records with it.
- **Five config dataclasses and their loader wiring, `utils/config.py`** —
  `MemoryBankConfig` (`memory.fast_bank` / `slow_bank`), `TitansConfig`
  (`memory.titans`), `ContrastiveConfig` (`memory.contrastive`),
  `ReflectionConfig` (`memory.reflection`), `ChunkingConfig`
  (`AppConfig.chunking`); plus the scalars `MemoryConfig.memory_engine`,
  `DreamConfig.relation_confidence` (its own comment already said
  `edge_confidence()` superseded it), and `ContextConfig.history_length`.
  **Not a breaking config change:** `_dict_to_dataclass` filters to known
  field names and `load_config` reads each section through an explicit
  `if "x" in raw` gate, so unknown keys have always been ignored rather than
  rejected. Verified by loading a v0.4.x-era `config.yaml` carrying every
  removed section: it parses with no error and the live keys beside them are
  still honoured. `TitansConfig`'s docstring claimed it existed to keep such
  files loading; that was never what made them load.
- **Uncalled methods.** `ContinuumMemorySystem.begin_logical_turn` /
  `end_logical_turn` / `slot_view_for_entries` / `introspection` (`memory/cms.py`);
  `MemoryService.extract_slots_regex` (the gateway dream calls `RegexExtractor`
  directly) and `MemoryService._dream_vocab` (a one-line wrapper over
  `_dream_hints`); `ReferenceBank.delete_document`; `slots.format_slots_for_context`
  and `slots.merge_slots_view` (the latter orphaned by `slot_view_for_entries`
  going); `contradiction._shared_anchor` (a thin wrapper over
  `_shared_anchor_kind`) and the `STATE_TRANSITION_SIM_THRESHOLD` back-compat
  alias, whose three tier-specific floors are what the code reads.
  **Note:** removing the two `*_logical_turn` methods leaves the rest of that
  seam dormant but intact — `last_logical_turn` is still a live column in
  `storage/schema.py` and `retrieve(min_logical_turn=...)` still filters on
  it, so re-adding the two setters re-activates the feature. `cms.py` now says
  so at `_in_logical_turn`.
- **`GraphStore` Protocol removed from `memory/graph_store.py`** — nothing
  annotated against it; the port's real contract is the backend-agnostic suite
  in `tests/test_graph_store.py`, which `PostgresNetworkxGraphStore` (alive,
  constructed in `service.py`) still passes.
- **Write-only attributes.** `EmbeddingPipeline.cache_hits` / `cache_misses`
  (incremented on every cache probe, never read — the counters were not
  reported anywhere), `MemoryService._last_user_query`, and
  `PostgresStorage.capabilities` (`ensure_schema` is still called for its side
  effect; only the unread assignment is gone).
- **Unused imports and residue.** `torch`, `RetrievalResult`, and four config
  classes in `service.py`; `dataclasses.field` in `episodes.py` / `slots.py` /
  `world_cortex.py`; `sys` / `time` / `teacher_extract` / `MIRASBand` across
  four `evals/` scripts; a dead `cols` local in `evals/ladder_sweep.py`; an
  `... if False else None` no-op in `tests/test_lessons_service.py`; and the
  orphaned `evals/lme_v2_check1_client.py`, superseded by
  `evals/lme_v2_check_fixd.py`.

### Added (2026-07-30 — the eval harness reports the commit-gated cascade)
> **RETIRED 2026-08-25 (#188): the oracle 0.936 quoted below.** The derived
> metric stays in the harness, but its router reads the answerer's
> abstention behaviour, which does not transfer across bench instruments —
> on the Qwen3.8 stack the same slice scores 0.846. See the `[Unreleased]`
> re-framing entry.
- **`cascade` derived metric across the LongMemEval tooling.** Every judged
  run already answers the `cortex` and `rag` arms, and per-question analysis
  of the `ceiling-e2e` artifacts showed the cortex arm's *commitment* (not
  abstaining) is a strong correctness signal — commit precision 46/46 on the
  oracle slice, 0.76±0.05 on the `_s` haystacks. The commit-gated cascade
  (serve the cortex answer when it commits, fall back to rag on "I don't
  know") beat both naive RAG and the concatenation hybrid in all 8 existing
  runs examined (oracle: 0.936 vs 0.859/0.833; `_s`: 0.428±0.023 vs
  0.321/0.367), so the harness now derives it everywhere: bench `--report`
  summaries, `replicate.py agg`, and `replicate.py compare --arm cascade`.
  Pure post-processing — no new answer calls, nothing persisted per-row, old
  JSONLs report it retroactively. The derivation lives in `replicate.py`
  (import-light) and the bench imports it; covered by
  `tests/test_eval_replicate.py`.

### Fixed (2026-07-30 — a console switch that changed nothing, and the escape hatch it hid)

- **`memory.show_superseded` retired; the real gate is now reachable as
  `memory.hide_superseded`.** The console knob was a no-op in both
  directions: `cms.retrieve` deliberately ignores `show_superseded`
  (hard-filtering on supersession is what made a category query miss the
  only entry naming the category), and the gate it *does* read —
  `hide_superseded` — was never a declared `MemoryConfig` field, so
  `load_config` dropped it from YAML and the console could not set it
  either. The affordance documented in `cms.py` ("set
  `config.hide_superseded = True` to restore the v0.7.2 filter") was
  therefore reachable only by hand-assigning an attribute in Python.
  `hide_superseded: bool = False` is now declared, parsed from
  `memory.hide_superseded`, and registered as the console knob "Hide
  superseded"; the dead field and its knob are gone. Old config files
  carrying `memory.show_superseded` still load — the retired key is
  ignored, which is exactly what it already did.
- **Default retrieval behaviour is unchanged**: superseded entries stay
  visible, downranked ×0.55, in both the dense and BM25 pools. That is
  deliberate — they carry knowledge-update recall (LongMemEval KU) and are
  what lets an answer describe a fact's history. Hiding them is a
  debug/audit switch, now documented as such in
  [`docs/guide/retrieval.md`](docs/guide/retrieval.md) and the defaults
  list in [`docs/guide/configuration.md`](docs/guide/configuration.md).
  `tests/test_superseded_visibility.py` pins the default, the gate in both
  pools, the YAML parse, legacy-key tolerance, and the console-knob-to-gate
  path end to end.

### Changed (2026-07-30 — the ceiling table promoted onto the reproducible stack)

- **The published local-ceiling table (README front door + benchmarks guide)
  now shows `ceiling-v25`** — the 2026-07-29 re-judge of the same contexts on
  stock `llama-server` + `q8_0` (3 byte-identical replicates, std 0.0000) —
  in place of the v2 / TurboQuant figures, which move to a marked
  **Superseded** block in the guide. This is the promotion the 0.11.0 entry
  left pending. It is not a cell swap: the old stack was scoring the
  verbatim-input control arm ~6 points low, so four narrative claims
  measured against that control change with the cells —
  - hybrid's margin over naive RAG: ~14 points → **~10 points**
    (0.7308 vs 0.6282);
  - "the fact spine alone matches RAG's accuracy" → cortex **trails RAG by
    ~4 points** (0.5897 vs 0.6282);
  - cortex's share of RAG's token budget: "under 8%" → **~11%**
    (182.5 / 1637.8 tokens);
  - hybrid's context share: ~64% → **~67%** (1101.8 / 1637.8).
  Two things remain held fixed by the context rebuild and are stated under
  the table: **extraction** (the 2026-07-19 bank dumps) and **raw-turn
  selection** (the pre-v25 retriever picked the turns; BM25 is never
  exercised) — only the cortex fact ranking runs under the v25 backbone.
  The E4B-vs-ceiling sentence is re-scoped to the same-stack comparison it
  always was (0.762 ± 0.027 vs 0.710 ± 0.019, both on the TurboQuant fork);
  no cross-stack claim is made against the promoted 0.7308.
  Evidence rows in `tests/test_eval_evidence.py` are repointed in the same
  change: `ceiling-*` accuracy and token rows now check the `ceiling-v25`
  artifacts, new `ceiling-hist-*` rows pin the retained historical block to
  the v2 artifacts, and the README's token column is pinned for the first
  time — unguarded, its hybrid cell had silently drifted to "~1000" against
  an artifact saying 1043.3.

### Fixed (2026-07-29 — the translated front doors claimed a gate that does not exist)
- **i18n source bumped to v6; all five translations re-synced.** The source
  said "a novelty-gated store drops near-duplicates", which is false at the
  shipped default: `surprise_threshold` is `0.0`
  (`pseudolife_memory/utils/config.py:657`, forced for the daemon build at
  `service.py:573-574`), so the gate never fires and nothing is dropped. The
  equivalent claim was corrected in the English README during the 0.11.0
  currency pass; the translated front doors were deliberately left at v5 that
  cycle, and this closes them out. The clause is removed rather than
  reworded — the surrounding sentence is about *what the agent stores*, and
  the gate is not part of that story at the shipped default.
- **The guard now pins the version a reader sees, not just the one the
  machine sees.** Each translation declares its sync version twice: the
  `<!-- i18n-sync: vN -->` comment, and a human-readable line near the top
  (`synced: v6 (2026-07-29)`, `已同步:v6 …`, `同期バージョン: v6 …`). Only the
  comment was pinned, so bumping it alone left every non-English reader
  looking at "v5" while the guard enforced v6. `tests/test_i18n_readme.py`
  now requires the source's `vN (YYYY-MM-DD)` stamp to appear in each
  translation — matched on the stamp rather than any one language's phrasing.

### Added (2026-07-29 — Dependabot told not to re-break the CPU-only image)

- **`.github/dependabot.yml`, ignore-only: `setuptools >=82` will not be
  proposed again.** The pinned torch 2.12.0 itself requires `setuptools<82`,
  so a lockfile bump past that ceiling makes pip discard the pinned CPU torch
  and pull PyPI's CUDA build — the silent 4 GB regression fixed earlier
  today. CI already rejects such a bump with the conflict named; this stops
  the PR from being re-proposed at all. `open-pull-requests-limit: 0` keeps
  scheduled version updates disabled (they never ran before this file
  existed); security updates continue except where ignored. Lift the rule
  only when bumping torch past its ceiling in the same change.

### Fixed (2026-07-29 — the test suite peaked at ~50 GB and could kill its own run)

- **The suite loads each distinct embedding model once per session: peak
  private commit ~49.5 GB → 5.39 GB, runtime 13:23 → 6:44** (full suite, 1792
  tests, measured 2026-07-29 with the fix and its guard tests in the tree). `warm_service` is module-scoped and every `MemoryService` built its
  own `SentenceTransformer`; under the schema-v25 default
  (`Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B`, measured **2.52 GB resident apiece**, ~26×
  the MiniLM it replaced) that was ~90 loads per run — enough to crash the
  suite outright on a 64 GB host, which it did once on 2026-07-29. Dropping a
  service frees nothing (reference cycles), and even a full `gc.collect()`
  returned only a quarter of the memory (the allocator keeps its arenas), so
  the footprint was a one-way ratchet.
- `tests/conftest.py` now memoizes the **model load** — deliberately not the
  `EmbeddingPipeline`, so every pipeline keeps its own encode LRU and dim
  state and nothing crosses a test boundary. One piece of state that separate
  instances provided implicitly survives by design:
  `EmbeddingPipeline.__init__` caps `model.max_seq_length` *in place*,
  reading the current value as its floor, so a shared model would ratchet the
  cap down permanently across configs. The memoization key therefore includes
  the config's cap; differently-capped pipelines get their own model. Pinned
  by `tests/test_shared_embedding_weights.py`, whose hazard test was verified
  load-bearing (removing the cap from the key turns it red). Production is
  untouched — the daemon builds one service per process.

### Fixed (2026-07-29 — the CPU-only image had been shipping CUDA for five days)

- **The daemon image is CPU-only again: 12.6 GB → 5.03 GB, a 7.57 GB (60%)
  saving.** Every image built between 2026-07-24 and 2026-07-29 shipped
  `torch 2.13.0+cu130` and 19 `nvidia-*` / `cuda-*` / `triton` distributions —
  a full CUDA runtime inside a service that sets `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1`
  and has no GPU code path. Verified on the deployed build: the container now
  reports `torch 2.12.0+cpu`, `torch.version.cuda = None`, and zero CUDA
  distributions.

  **Root cause — a dependency *ceiling*, not a raised floor.** Nothing in the
  graph requires torch newer than the pinned 2.12.0 (the highest declared
  floors are extras-only, at `>=2.2`/`>=2.4`). The trigger ran the other way:
  `torch 2.12.0` itself requires `setuptools<82`, and a Dependabot bump
  (`17b97180`, 2026-07-24) moved `ops/requirements.lock.txt` to
  `setuptools==83.0.0`. A pip constraint file cannot be negotiated, so pip
  reported `Requirement already satisfied: torch>=2.1.0 ... (2.12.0+cpu)`,
  then backtracked *off* the pinned CPU torch — discarding it rather than the
  setuptools pin — and walked forward to 2.13.0, which declares no setuptools
  ceiling. PyPI's default linux torch wheel is the CUDA build, so ~4 GB of
  CUDA arrived with it. The constraint that poisoned the resolution never even
  reached the image: the Dockerfile forces setuptools back to 78.1.1 on the
  next line.

- **`ops/requirements.lock.txt` now pins `torch==2.12.0+cpu`** and holds
  `setuptools` at 78.1.1 (below torch's ceiling, and the CVE-2025-47273 patched
  release the image already shipped). torch used to be deliberately *absent*
  from the lock on the theory that installing it first made it unnecessary —
  which left the single largest dependency in the image unpinned. Because the
  `+cpu` local version exists only on PyTorch's own index, a future dependency
  that genuinely needs a newer torch now fails the build loudly
  (`ResolutionImpossible`, naming the conflict) instead of quietly swapping in
  a CUDA wheel.

- **The `ops/Dockerfile.daemon` comment asserting the opposite is corrected.**
  It claimed the up-front CPU install meant the constrained install "never
  pulls the multi-GB CUDA build from PyPI" — false for the whole window above.

- **Guard added** (`tests/test_daemon_image_is_cpu_only.py`): the lockfile must
  pin a `+cpu` torch and carry no CUDA distributions; the Dockerfile, the
  lockfile, and CI must not drift apart on the torch version; and the lockfile's
  `setuptools` pin must satisfy the pinned torch's own ceiling — the last of
  which fails on exactly the Dependabot bump that caused this. A `slow`-marked
  test asserts it end-to-end against the built image, skipping when Docker or
  the image is absent.

### Added (2026-07-29 — supersede-at-discovery affordances)
- **Aged, stale, or contested facts now carry a ready-made `correct_with`
  call on the MCP read surface.** `memory_search` (cortex block),
  `memory_fact_get`, and `memory_world_search` attach the exact
  `memory_fact_set(...)` / `memory_world_set(...)` invocation for the
  fact's slot, and the response carries a one-line `correction_note`
  stating the norm: if the fact contradicts observed reality, run the
  correction at discovery — re-assert the same value to confirm it.
  Motivation: a session recalled a world fact describing work as pending
  that had shipped 11 days earlier, reported the contradiction in prose,
  and left the record standing (2026-07-29); the briefing instruction
  alone demonstrably does not produce supersede-at-discovery, so the
  affordance moves to the moment of recall, where correcting costs a
  copy-paste instead of a recalled procedure.
- **`freshness.needs_correction_nudge`** gates the affordance at **TTL/3**
  (volatile ≈ 7 days, slow ≈ 90 days, evergreen never) — deliberately
  ahead of the 2×TTL `stale` flag, which the 11-day-old incident fact had
  not yet reached. Stale and contested facts are flagged regardless of
  age. Pinned by `tests/test_correction_affordance.py`. The tool
  docstrings deliberately do not describe the field — the core manifest
  budget is at capacity, and the in-band `correction_note` teaches it at
  the moment it applies.
- **TRUST ORDER briefing sharpened** (both `session_hook.py` and its
  byte-pinned twin `examples/CLAUDE.memory.md`): recall results mark
  aged/contested facts with `correct_with`; correcting is part of
  discovering, not a follow-up. Session-end reflection (detecting
  recalled-but-contradicted facts at episode close) was evaluated and
  deferred — the observed failure mode stores nothing for the daemon to
  detect; see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-29-supersede-at-discovery-design.md`.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-29 — a better retriever, and facts that admit their age

The embedding backbone moved to `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B` at 1024
dimensions (schema **v25**), chosen by a recall shootout on this project's
own corpus rather than on a leaderboard: **R@10 0.572 → 0.809** over a
74,183-turn haystack, with queries and documents now encoded asymmetrically.
Alongside it, canonical facts stopped pretending to be timeless — every
cortex fact carries `asserted_at` and a human `age`, and a `freshness_class`
(schema v23) decays confidence and flags `stale`, inferred by default from
the entity's kind (schema v24). A round of band-integrity fixes closes paths
where overflow could destroy memories outright, and four sources of
graph-review noise were closed at the write path instead of swept up after.

**Upgrading requires one manual step.** The `vector(384)` → `vector(1024)`
move is not additive: the daemon **refuses to start** against an
older-dimensioned bank rather than half-migrating it. Back up, stop the
daemon, and re-embed offline with `ops/migrate_embeddings.py` — see
[the v25 migration runbook](docs/runbooks/embedding-v25-migration.md).

### Fixed (2026-07-29 — `mcp 2.0.0` broke every fresh install the day it shipped)
- **The `mcp` dependency is upper-bounded to `<2`.** `pyproject.toml` asked
  for `mcp>=1.0.0` with no ceiling, so the moment the SDK published 2.0.0 a
  clean `pip install` resolved to it — and 2.0.0 relocated
  `mcp.server.fastmcp`, which `pseudolife_memory/mcp_server.py` imports at
  module scope. The failure is at import, so it takes out the server, not
  merely a test. `ops/requirements.lock.txt` has always pinned a 1.x
  (currently `1.28.1`, verified importing `fastmcp` in the running
  container); this makes the source distribution agree with the image
  instead of quietly resolving somewhere else.
  **Why it surfaced here:** nothing in this release touched dependencies.
  Master's last CI run was green five hours earlier on the same tree — the
  release branch simply had the misfortune to be the first build after the
  upstream major. A local venv pinned at `1.27.2` could never have caught
  it; only an unpinned resolve does, which is exactly what a user gets.
  Supporting 2.x is a real migration (the SDK is used across `fastmcp`,
  `lowlevel`, `client.session`, `streamable_http` and `stdio_server`), not a
  version bump, and is deliberately not attempted here.

### Added (2026-07-29 — the old serving stack was biased, not just noisy)
- **The ceiling table re-measured on the reproducible server, and the control
  arm moved further than either treatment arm.** `ceiling-v25` rebuilds the
  published ceiling run's contexts from the same committed bank dumps under
  current v25 knobs and re-judges on stock `llama-server` + `q8_0`
  (`evals/results/longmemeval-ku-oracle-qwen-27b-ceiling-v25.agg.json`,
  3 replicates, std 0.0000 on every arm):

  | arm | v25 / q8_0 | published (v2 / TurboQuant) | Δ |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | naive RAG (**control**) | 0.6282 | 0.5667 ± 0.0167 | **+0.0615** |
  | cortex facts only | 0.5897 | 0.5590 ± 0.0295 | +0.0307 |
  | hybrid | 0.7308 | 0.7102 ± 0.0194 | +0.0206 |

  `rebuild_contexts.py` copies the rag context **verbatim** — that arm's
  input is byte-identical across the two runs — so its +0.0615 cannot be a
  retrieval effect. It is the answerer/judge stack alone, and at 3.7× the old
  measurement's own standard deviation it is a **systematic offset, not
  variance**. That sharpens the 2026-07-27 finding: the TurboQuant fork's
  fused TBQ4_0 KV was not merely flipping ~7% of verdicts at random, it was
  scoring this slice about six points low.
  All three replicates came back **byte-identical** (`sha256` prefix
  `1a97bea2caa3e191d5ab7687c73546c9`) — not merely equal in score but
  identical answer for answer and verdict for verdict, which is the strongest
  available statement that the reproducible config is reproducible. Only the
  base `.jsonl` is committed for that reason: the other two replicates are
  the same bytes, and the aggregate already records all three accuracies.
  **Consequence:** no number measured on the old stack is comparable to one
  measured now, in either direction, and the gap is larger than most of the
  effects these tables report. The deltas above are therefore *not* evidence
  about v25 — the clean same-stack v25 comparison is the regression gate
  below. The published tables are left as they stand pending a deliberate
  promotion; `ceiling-v25` is committed as the tagged candidate.
  *[Superseded 2026-07-30: the promotion has landed — the README and guide
  tables now publish `ceiling-v25`; see Unreleased.]*

### Fixed (2026-07-29 — a sixth file was coupled to the "five-file version cut")
- **`tests/test_ops_update_rollback.py` derives the daemon version from
  `ops/docker-compose.yml` instead of hard-coding it.** The assertion pinned
  the literal `pseudolife-daemon:0.10.0-unittest`, so it went red the moment
  this release bumped the compose tag — the version cut presenting itself as
  a regression in the rollback path, which is the one path you least want to
  distrust while cutting a release. The update scripts already read that tag
  from compose as the single source of truth; the test now reads it the same
  way, and no longer needs touching on a cut.

### Added (2026-07-29 — the v25 backbone finally ran the regression gate)
- **The gate PASSES on the shipped v25 configuration**, measured against the
  pinned oracle/`e4b-ft` arm1 slice and committed as
  `evals/results/regression_gate-2026-07-29-v25-backbone-verify.agg.json`
  (2 replicates, 78 questions, contexts rebuilt from banks with current
  knobs). Deltas against the `1f0f13a` baseline:

  | arm | v25 | baseline | Δ |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | naive RAG (control) | 0.6282 | 0.6282 | 0.0000 |
  | cortex facts only | 0.6923 | 0.7051 | −0.0128 |
  | hybrid | 0.7821 | 0.7692 | +0.0129 |

  Both moved arms sit inside the 0.03 margin, and `std` is 0.0000 on all
  three across both replicates — confirming the run was served by the
  reproducible q8_0 config and not the fast build. The control arm is
  *byte-identical*: it reads raw turns and never touches the retriever, so
  its zero is what licenses reading the other two as real.
  **Why this is a late entry:** the baseline was established 2026-07-27
  (`1f0f13a`) and the backbone swap landed 2026-07-28 (`7d20443b`), so the
  single most retrieval-affecting change in this release reached the release
  gate without the retrieval gate ever having been run against it. On the
  slice, a 1024-d backbone with R@10 0.809 buys nothing end-to-end over a
  384-d one at 0.572 — better recall did not become better answers here,
  which is worth knowing before reading the shootout as a product claim.

### Fixed (2026-07-29 — the `relate` action suggested a relation no fresh bank could store)
- **`implements` is now a builtin relation.** The file/concept review finding
  added on 2026-07-26 proposes `<file> implements <concept>`, but `implements`
  was never in `_BUILTIN_RELATIONS`, and the relation registry is a closed
  vocabulary: `graph_relate` rejected it with `unknown_relation` and — because
  `implements` matches no seeded name above `difflib`'s 0.5 cutoff — an
  **empty** `suggestions` list, leaving the user no recovery hint. Seeding is
  idempotent (`ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING`), so existing banks pick it up
  on the next daemon start.
  **Why it survived review:** the relation had been hand-defined on the
  development bank, so every manual test of the Atlas Relate button passed.
  The feature was broken only on a *fresh* install — the one configuration
  nobody had. That CHANGELOG entry even asserts "the `implements` relation
  already described exactly this case", which was true of the live bank and
  false of the shipped vocabulary. The regression test now resolves every
  relation the review layer can suggest against `_BUILTIN_RELATIONS` rather
  than against whatever the live registry has drifted to.

### Added (2026-07-29 — the Arm-1 significance claim gets its artifact)
- **`replicate.py compare` run for the Arm-1 vs baseline pair**, producing
  `longmemeval-ku-oracle-e4b-ft-arm1-vs-baseline-{cortex,hybrid,rag}.compare.json`.
  The published p-values reproduce exactly (cortex Δ+0.0795 p=0.16958; hybrid
  Δ+0.0128 p=0.82862), so the table was accurate — it simply had no evidence
  behind it, which is the failure `tests/test_eval_evidence.py` exists to
  prevent. The **`rag` control arm** (Δ−0.0103, p=0.40586) is now published
  beside them: its input is identical across both runs, so it bounds what the
  other arms can claim.

### Changed (2026-07-27 — the gate's spread was the serving stack, not the judge)
- **`regression_gate.ps1` defaults to `-Replicates 2` again, and the baseline
  is re-established at n=7 with std 0.0000 on every arm** (rag 0.6282,
  cortex 0.7051, hybrid 0.7692). The ~0.03 cortex spread that justified
  raising the default to 10 the previous day was the TurboQuant fork's fused
  TBQ4_0 KV cache, not judge nondeterminism: it flips ~6.8–7.7% of verdicts
  on byte-identical input (`evals/results/judge-determinism-check.json`),
  while the stock `llama-server` with `--cache-type-k/v q8_0` reproduces
  exactly. Replicates are therefore a drift canary, not an estimator — if two
  disagree, the run was served by the wrong binary. The gate also got *more*
  sensitive: the margin `max(0.03, 2*std)` collapses to the 0.03 floor
  instead of the 0.0637 the noise used to buy.
  **Why this entry is dated late:** the change shipped on 2026-07-27 and
  `evals/README.md` retired the superseded numbers at their own site, but the
  CHANGELOG was never updated, so `[Unreleased]` went on presenting the
  10-replicate baseline as current for two days.

### Added (2026-07-28 — Docker build-cache retention)
- **`ops/prune-build-cache.ps1` / `.sh`** give the BuildKit cache a
  retention policy: an age pass (`docker builder prune --force --filter
  until=168h`, `-MaxAgeHours` / `--max-age-hours`), then a size-ceiling
  pass (`--max-used-space`, default 20GB, `-MaxUsedSpaceGB` /
  `--max-used-space-gb`) only if still over cap after the age pass, then a
  Windows/WSL-only `fstrim` of the `docker-desktop` disk. `-DryRun` /
  `--dry-run` reports an estimate and changes nothing; `-NoTrim` /
  `--no-trim` runs the prune but skips fstrim. The sibling of the
  2026-07-14 rollback-tag retention: one deploy produces ~12.45GB of cache
  across 17 entries, and 51.87GB across 169 entries — all inactive, some
  5-6 weeks old — had accumulated by 2026-07-28, with ~52GB regrowing in
  the 13 days after the prior manual trim.
- **fstrim is invoked as `wsl -d docker-desktop -e sh -c "fstrim -v
  /mnt/docker-desktop-disk"`, not as the bare `-e fstrim` target.** `wsl -d
  <distro> -e <cmd>` fails to resolve `fstrim` when passed directly as the
  `-e` target, even though `/sbin` (where `fstrim` lives) is on the
  child's `PATH` (`execvpe(fstrim) failed: No such file or directory`);
  `sh -c` works because the shell performs its own `PATH` lookup instead
  of relying on wsl's relay to do it. Verified live to reclaim 207.2MiB.
  Pinned by `tests/test_ops_prune_build_cache.py`.
- **The size-ceiling pass is a weaker backstop than the age pass, not a
  peer mechanism.** Measured 2026-07-28 against a 12.45GB / 17-entry
  cache: `docker builder prune --force --max-used-space 8000000000`
  reclaimed **0B**, because 14 of the 17 entries were `Shared=true` with
  the live daemon image, and a build-cache prune cannot free layers an
  existing image still holds — only the 3 unshared entries (3.314MB
  total) were actually prunable. The ceiling pass can therefore be a
  no-op during exactly the "heavy build week" it exists to cover; it only
  starts reclaiming once that cache has unshared, i.e. after the images
  holding it are removed (e.g. by `ops/prune-rollbacks.*`). The age pass
  is the primary mechanism in the steady state. **Superseded 2026-08-06:**
  the 0B here was misattributed — the dominant cause was the missing
  `--all`, without which `docker builder prune` removes nothing at all
  under the containerd image store; with `--all` the ceiling pass
  verifiably reclaims shared-record cache with live images untouched. See
  the Unreleased fix entry and `docs/runbooks/docker-disk-retention.md`.
- **`ops/update.ps1` / `.sh` prune after a healthy deploy**, via
  `-KeepCacheHours` / `--keep-cache-hours` (default 168) and
  `-NoCachePrune` / `--no-cache-prune`. Placement is load-bearing: before
  the build it would delete the cache that build reuses, and on the
  unhealthy path it would strip the cache a rollback rebuild needs (that
  branch exits first, so retention is skipped for free). Non-fatal —
  retention never fails a deploy that already succeeded.
- **`ops/install-cache-retention.ps1`** registers a weekly Windows
  Scheduled Task (`-DayOfWeek` / `-At`, default Sunday 03:00;
  `-Unregister` removes it) for stretches with no deploys. Windows-only,
  and must be registered from the permanent checkout, not a worktree — it
  bakes its own directory into the registered command, so a worktree
  registration breaks silently once that worktree is deleted. Re-run it
  if the checkout ever moves.
- **`ops/compact-docker-vhdx.ps1` + `docs/runbooks/docker-disk-retention.md`.**
  `fstrim` frees space inside the VM but never shrinks the host `.vhdx`;
  only an offline `Optimize-VHD -Mode Full` does, and that needs
  elevation plus full Docker downtime, so it stays manual. The script
  pre-flights `Optimize-VHD` availability (ships with the Hyper-V module;
  absent on Windows Home) and rejects a non-file `-Path` before stopping
  anything.
- Scope guard: these scripts only ever call `docker builder prune`. Never
  images, containers, `docker system prune`, or any volume command —
  enforced by `tests/test_ops_prune_build_cache.py`, not by convention.

### Fixed (2026-07-28 — five `ops/*.sh` scripts were not executable in git)
- **Executable bit restored on `ops/install-shim-autostart.sh`, `ops/install.sh`,
  `ops/preflight.sh`, `ops/prune-build-cache.sh`, `ops/prune-rollbacks.sh`** —
  all five were tracked as mode `100644`, which clones as non-executable on
  Linux/macOS. `ops/update.sh` invokes `prune-rollbacks.sh` and
  `prune-build-cache.sh` by bare path; both failures were swallowed by a
  `WARNING`-and-continue wrapper, so rollback-tag retention has been a silent
  no-op on every Linux/macOS deploy since `prune-rollbacks.sh` shipped
  (commit `b47430de`, 2026-07-14). `ops/install.sh` being non-executable also
  broke the documented quickstart (README.md and every translated
  `docs/i18n/README.*.md` tell a fresh clone to run it directly).
  `tests/test_ops_script_modes.py` guards the git index mode of every tracked
  `ops/*.sh` file so this cannot regress silently again.

### Added (2026-07-28 — v25 embedding migration script)
- **`ops/migrate_embeddings.py`** takes a live v24 bank (four
  `vector(384)` embedding columns) to v25 (`vector(1024)`) offline: dry-
  run by default (writes nothing without `--apply`), requires
  `--backup-verified` to apply, and refuses to apply while the daemon
  answers its health endpoint (a live writer re-embedding underneath the
  daemon's own in-memory state would corrupt the bank). Each of
  `entries`/`facts`/`world_facts`/`lessons` is migrated in its own
  transaction — drop NOT NULL where present, `ALTER COLUMN embedding TYPE
  vector(1024) USING NULL`, re-embed every row through the real
  `EmbeddingPipeline` and the exact claim-text shape the write paths use
  (`cortex_write`/`world_write`/`lesson_write`'s
  `f"{entity} {attribute} {value}".strip()`; entries re-embed their
  stored `text` verbatim), restore constraints — and creates no index
  (there is none to rebuild; `ensure_schema` already drops
  `entries_embedding_idx` unconditionally on every boot). Stamps
  `meta.schema_version = 25` last, only after all four tables migrate
  without error. This is the human-gated remedy for schema v25's
  additive-only `ensure_schema` refusing to start against a v24-
  dimensioned bank; running it against the live bank is a user-gated
  morning step, not part of this change.

### Changed (2026-07-28 — embedding backbone swap; schema **v25**)
- **Default embedding model is now `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B`** (was
  `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). Measured on the project's own LongMemEval-derived
  corpus (150 questions, 74,183 haystack turns, 299 gold; PR #59
  artifacts): R@10 0.809 vs bge-base-en-v1.5's 0.742 and shipped MiniLM's
  0.572 (+81/-6 @5 vs MiniLM, p≈0). fp32 torch in-process, no GPU
  sidecar: 2.4 GB RAM, ~82ms median / ~101ms p90 per query on CPU with
  the project's existing sentence-transformers/transformers versions —
  no dependency bump. Qwen3-Embedding is instruction-asymmetric
  (`EmbeddingConfig.query_prefix`, `EmbeddingPipeline.encode_query` —
  landed ahead of this swap); every retrieval probe across
  `service.py`'s 23 classified encode sites now goes through
  `encode_query` (see the threading entry below).
- **Schema v25: `entries`/`facts`/`world_facts`/`lessons.embedding` move
  from `vector(384)` to `vector(1024)`.** `ensure_schema` stays
  additive-only — a vector dimension change is not additive, so it now
  REFUSES to start (before any DDL, naming `ops/migrate_embeddings.py`)
  when a live bank's `entries.embedding` is dimensioned but not at 1024,
  rather than half-migrating four tables at startup or writing
  1024-d vectors into 384-d columns. The ONNX backend has no in-repo
  export for Qwen3-0.6B, so the daemon runs the torch backend for it
  (falls back cleanly, same fail-soft path as any other ONNX-unavailable
  model); the ONNX machinery itself is unchanged and still used for
  MiniLM-family models.
- Threshold defaults calibrated on MiniLM cosine distributions
  (`alias_candidate_min_cosine`, `curation_min_similarity`, surprise
  gate, recall `min_score` floors) are left unchanged — those absolute
  cosine distributions shift under a new backbone, but recalibrating
  them is out of scope for this change and is deferred to live data.
- **Retrieval floors (the `min_score` 0.2/0.25 class) now gate a
  prefixed-query-to-document cosine, not a doc-to-doc one** — now that
  query-side call sites use `encode_query`'s instruction prefix
  (Task 3), those thresholds' semantics shifted, not just their scale;
  left unrecalibrated pending live data, per the bullet above.
  `supersede()`'s embedding-fallback paraphrase probe is one of the
  now-asymmetric comparisons, so it reads as somewhat more conservative
  at the shipped default.

### Fixed (2026-07-28 — v25 review fix wave)
- **The daemon image now bakes `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B`** — it
  previously baked only `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` while the default moved to
  Qwen3 under `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`, so a container built from that state
  booted healthy and then threw `OSError` on the first memory tool call.
  A guard test pins the Dockerfile bake to `EmbeddingConfig.model_name`'s
  default so the two can't drift apart again.
- **Legacy `.pt` bank migration re-embeds on a dimension mismatch.**
  `migrate_legacy` used to insert a legacy bank's stored entry embeddings
  verbatim; a real legacy bank is 384-d (MiniLM-era) and now fails a
  `vector(1024)` insert every boot (swallowed to a retried warning). It
  now re-embeds any entry whose stored embedding doesn't match the live
  pipeline's dimension, through that same `EmbeddingPipeline` instance.
- **`migrate_legacy`'s cortex-facts branch gets the same re-embed-on-
  dim-mismatch treatment.** It previously inserted a legacy fact's stored
  claim embedding verbatim via `replace_facts` — on a real (384-d) legacy
  bank this raised AFTER the entries loop had already committed, so the
  `.pre-v8.bak` rename was never reached and the idempotency guard
  (`storage.load_entries() or storage.load_facts()`) then permanently
  blocked every retry, losing the legacy facts for good. Now re-embeds
  from each record's own `(entity, attribute, value)` claim text before
  insertion, same as the entries branch.
- **`ops/restore_from_pt.py` refuses on an embedding-dimension mismatch**
  instead of inserting a snapshot's vectors verbatim. It restores a
  same-era `.pt` snapshot into the live bank (disaster recovery, not a
  migration tool), so a pre-v25 384-d `.bak` restored after the live bank
  moved to `vector(1024)` previously either raised partway through the
  entries loop (a partial, silent restore — each `insert_entry` commits
  on its own) or risked corrupting a future batched insert path. It now
  checks every stored embedding's length against the live bank's declared
  dimension before writing anything, and exits 1 with nothing written on
  any mismatch.
- **`/health` reports `init_refusal` + `status: "degraded"`** when
  `MemoryService._ensure_init`'s storage construction hits schema v25's
  dimension-mismatch refusal — previously invisible until the first tool
  call, since the refusal fires lazily and `/health` doesn't construct
  storage eagerly.

### Added (2026-07-28 — embedding backbone decided on our corpus: Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B)
- **Seven-arm fp32 shootout** on the LongMemEval slice (150 questions,
  74,183 haystack turns, 299 gold;
  `evals/results/embedder-recall-shootout-20260727.json`):
  Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B reaches R@10 **0.809** vs bge-base-en-v1.5 0.742,
  beating every arm at every k. Both anchors (MiniLM, bge-base) reproduced
  the PR #44 artifact exactly. bge's card-recommended query prefix does not
  help on this corpus; granite-r2 and arctic-l-v2 land below bge-base
  despite higher leaderboard standings — leaderboard rank did not transfer,
  twice.
- **Direct paired test** (`embedder-recall-qwen-vs-bge-20260728.json`):
  Qwen3 over bge-base +32/−12 at k=10, p=0.004; significant at every k.
- **Quantization round** (`embedder-recall-quant-shootout-20260728.json`):
  Q8_0 GGUF matches fp32 (R@10 0.806 vs 0.809, statistical noise) at a
  quarter of the RAM (0.6 GB). Scale does not pay at Q4: the 4B at Q4_K_M
  lands BELOW the fp32 0.6B (R@10 0.753, the round's only significant
  delta — negative), and 8B-Q4 plus both Nemotron-3-Embed-1B forms are
  statistical washes against the 0.6B at 4–8x its footprint. Matryoshka
  truncation to 1024d measured free on both 4B and Nemotron.
- Harness (`evals/embedder_recall.py`): candidate registry with
  card-verbatim prefixes recorded per arm (instruction-tuned embedders
  swing on exact wording), llama-server GGUF adapter (forced
  `--pooling last`; cross-validated against fp32 at cosine 0.9987 before
  any arm ran), Matryoshka-truncation arms, per-gold hit vectors persisted
  for post-hoc pairwise tests, incremental artifact writes, 512-token cap
  on every arm for fairness and VRAM safety.
- **The backbone swap itself (schema v25, `vector(1024)`, full re-embed)
  has NOT been performed** — this entry records the model decision and its
  evidence only.

### Fixed (2026-07-27 — user-set entity kinds survive a model re-apply)
- **`apply_entity_kinds` now locks `origin='user'` rows against the
  artifact.** The classifier repeats its mistakes — the `miras-bands`
  mislabel appeared in both gold replicates — so the first hand-correction
  written to `entity_kinds` would have been silently reinstated by the next
  re-apply, and the resulting `evergreen -> volatile` flip would not even
  show in the downgrade section, because it looks like the normal
  direction. User rows now win over a disagreeing artifact (reported in the
  dry run), and are skipped on agreement too — re-upserting would churn
  `origin` back to `model` and unlock the row for the run after.

### Added (2026-07-27 — freshness is inferred from the entity's kind; schema **v24**)
- **`entity_kinds` (schema v24) stores one kind per entity** — `artifact`
  (frozen in time), `system` (live), `concept` (abstract) — and
  `freshness.resolve_class(kind, attribute)` turns that into a fact's
  `freshness_class`. Only `system` entities can yield `volatile`, so the 282
  facts about frozen artifacts are structurally protected from decaying.
- **Why kind and not attribute name.** `0-9-0-release / schema-version` is
  permanently true; `daemon / schema-version` rots. Same attribute, opposite
  class — the name cannot decide it, the entity's kind can.
- **No model call on the write path.** A new fact looks its entity's kind up in
  a cached map and applies a pure function, because this runs on every dream.
  `freshness_class` now defaults to the sentinel `"auto"`; explicit values are
  still honoured, and an empty kind map reproduces v23 behaviour exactly.
- **Scoping, not batch size, is the token lever.** An entity only matters if it
  carries a transient attribute: 2,423 fact pairs → 265 scoped → 33
  rule-confident → 232 needing model judgement, a 10.4× reduction before a
  single call (measured 2026-07-27 on the live bank; these counts drift as
  the bank grows — reproduce with `python evals/classify_entity_kinds.py
  --scope-only`). Backfill runs at batch 50 over five calls. The backfill has
  **not** been run against the live bank — this ships the machinery only; an
  empty `entity_kinds` table resolves every fact to `evergreen`, so behaviour
  is unchanged until it is.
- Measured first: entity *aliasing* was the presumed root cause and is
  explicitly out of scope — on the live bank only ~4–6 of 74 lexical clusters
  are genuine aliases, reproducing the Stage 1.5 finding on real data.

### Fixed (2026-07-27 — `freshness_class` reaches the REST write path)
- **`POST /api/facts/set` now threads `freshness_class`.** v23 threaded the new
  field through the MCP tool and the service but not the REST route, whose
  lambda passed only entity/attribute/value/confidence/support — so every fact
  written through the Console or the REST fallback was silently pinned to
  `evergreen`. That path is not incidental: it is the documented workaround for
  MCP clients that stringify tool params. `FixtureService.cortex_write` gained
  the same parameter to keep the Console fixture contract in step.
- Two route-level regression tests pin both directions (explicit `volatile`
  survives; omitted stays `evergreen`, never the world cortex's `volatile`).
  RED-checked by removing the kwarg.

### Added (2026-07-27 — cortex facts can declare how fast they rot; schema **v23**)
- **`memory_fact_set` gained `freshness_class`** — `evergreen` (default),
  `slow` (~9 months) or `volatile` (~3 weeks), stored on the fact and
  projected on every read alongside a derived `effective_confidence` and a
  boolean `stale` (past twice the TTL). Non-evergreen facts decay toward a
  per-class floor with time since `last_confirmed`; re-asserting the same
  value confirms the fact and restores full confidence. This reuses the
  existing world-cortex freshness machinery (`memory/freshness.py`) rather
  than adding a second decay model.
- **The default is `evergreen`, deliberately not the world cortex's
  `volatile`.** Personal facts are mostly durable — identities, decisions,
  history — and defaulting the other way would silently re-rank every
  existing bank on an assumption nothing here has measured. Rows written
  before v23 read back as `evergreen`, so behaviour is unchanged until a
  slot is classified on purpose.
- **Scope, honestly.** This does *not* retroactively fix the 2026-07-26
  v1/v2 extractor-prompt incident that motivated the currency work: the
  misleading fact was ten days old against a 21-day TTL, so it would not
  have been flagged `stale`, and its `effective_confidence` would barely
  have moved. Visible dates (previous entry) were the load-bearing fix;
  this is the complementary half that helps once a fact is *months* stale.
  `tests/test_schema_v23.py` records that limit so a later reader does not
  over-credit the feature.
- Guide: [memory model → "How current is this fact?"](docs/guide/memory-model.md)
  now documents both halves — the projected dates shipped in the previous
  entry had no user-facing page, only a CHANGELOG record.
- **Unknown classes fall back to `evergreen` here, not `volatile`.** The
  shared `freshness.normalize_class` sends anything unrecognised to
  `volatile`, which is correct for world facts and inverts the intent on the
  personal cortex — a typo'd class would quietly start a durable fact
  decaying. `cortex._norm_freshness` overrides just that fallback.
- The tool docstring does **not** describe `freshness_class`: the `core`
  tier's 9,500-char manifest budget had ~14 chars of headroom, and the
  manifest is eager context in every session. The `Literal` type advertises
  the three values; the guide carries the meaning.

### Fixed (2026-07-26 — cortex facts now carry their age; mid-session recall codified)
- **`memory_search`'s `cortex` block now returns `asserted_at`,
  `last_confirmed` (ISO-8601, to the second) and the human `age`.** The data
  was already there — `service.cortex_search` has always returned those
  fields — but the MCP tool projected them away, so every cortex fact
  arrived undated and a stale one looked exactly as authoritative as a
  fresh one. Not even `verbose=True` added a date.
- **Why it matters.** The cortex is the layer an agent trusts most, and
  supersession only fires within one `(entity, attribute)` slot — so the
  *same* real fact recorded under a second entity name is never corrected
  and never flagged `contested`. Observed 2026-07-26: a query for the
  deployed extractor prompt returned
  `extraction-prompt-system-prompt/version = "v2"` beside
  `Sonnet sidecar/primary-extractor = "... (v1 prompt)"`, both
  `contested: false`, ten days apart, undated — and an agent in another
  session acted on v1. Second precision so two same-day writes to rival
  slots are still orderable.
- **The briefing now tells agents to recall more than once.** The
  SessionStart hook and `examples/CLAUDE.memory.md` gained a *RECALL AGAIN
  mid-session* list (user refers to work you weren't part of; before
  proposing a design, via `memory_lesson_search` for `polarity:-`
  dead-ends; before asserting a benchmark number, version or "current"
  value; when starting in an untouched area) and an explicit **TRUST
  ORDER**: memory tells you *why*, the repo tells you *what is*. When they
  disagree, say so, trust the code, and correct the fact at its slot rather
  than silently picking one.
- Entity canonicalisation — the root cause, since post-hoc key merging is a
  known dead end (23 true merges over 3,257 keys) — is deliberately left
  for separate work.

### Fixed (2026-07-26 — two defects found by live verification)
- **The retype pass now runs when there is no dream backlog.** It sat at the
  dream tail, so a dream with nothing to consolidate returned early and never
  drained the quarantine — exactly backwards, since the quarantine accumulates
  when dreams are INFREQUENT. Same precedent as lesson synthesis on that path:
  no new memories does not mean no pending work.
- **A git branch is no longer offered as the concept a file implements.**
  `file_concept_split` compares stems with separators and directory prefixes
  stripped, so `terra_shim.py` matched the branch `feat/terra-shim` and the
  queue suggested `implements` — but a branch is a VCS artifact, not a role,
  and a prior review had ruled that exact pair distinct. Branch-shaped
  counterparts are now rejected explicitly.

### Added (2026-07-26 — typed-relation retry over the quarantined edges)
- **Quarantined untyped edges get a second, better-posed question.** The 0.45
  `related-to` quarantine works — a triage of 32 of them found *zero* worth
  writing as-is — but ~44% named a REAL relationship that merely got the
  wrong label (`publishes-to`, `implements`, `operates-on`), and they simply
  accumulated. `retype_quarantined_links` re-asks the extractor for a TYPED
  relation using only the notes where both entities co-occur
  (`graph_consolidation.shared_mention_entries`). Focused evidence plus the
  current prompt — which demands the most specific relation and forbids
  `related-to` for co-mentions — makes this a genuinely different question
  from the one that produced the quarantined edge, with no new prompt surface.
- A typed answer files a **reviewable** `dream-retyped` proposal and settles
  the untyped original; a retype is a second guess on already-suspect
  material, so it never writes a live edge. No typed answer settles the
  original too — that is exactly the co-mention noise the quarantine exists to
  catch, and leaving it pending only regrows the queue. An extractor failure
  settles nothing and never raises.
- Runs at the dream tail, capped by `memory.dream.retype_quarantined_max`
  (default 3, `0` disables). Self-limiting: the pass no-ops on an empty
  quarantine, so a drained bank pays nothing.

### Fixed (2026-07-26 — graph hygiene round 3: four junk faucets closed at source)
- **Flattened slot keys no longer mint dotted entities.** `cortex.vocab()`
  renders hints as `entity.attribute`, but the bare list read as a list of
  *entity names*, so extractors periodically emitted
  `{"entity": "0-9-0-release.deployment-status", "attribute": "value"}` —
  minting a dotted entity duplicating a correctly-shaped fact. Three layers:
  the vocab hint now states the shape explicitly; `unflatten_slot_key_claims`
  repairs what still slips (split only when the attribute is literally
  `value` AND the prefix is a known entity, so `llama.cpp` and
  `host.docker.internal` survive); and `junk_entities` gains a
  `slot-key-artifact` class for existing ones, likewise requiring the prefix
  to be a known entity — the remaining dotted names in the bank
  (`facts.id`, `cms.retrieve`, `np.asarray`) are legitimate code/schema
  references and stay untouched.
- **Lesson-minted nodes are excluded from duplicate and orphan findings.**
  `unattributed()` already skipped entities whose every edge is a
  prefers/avoids lesson relation; the predicate is now shared as
  `lesson_only_ids` and applied to all three. These nodes are named
  `<artifact> <aspect>`, so they share nearly every token with the artifact
  they merely mention — dismissing a pair never stopped the next lesson from
  minting another — and they are weakly connected by construction, which
  inflated the orphan count with entries no action could ever resolve.
- **A contentless entity can no longer be a merge target.** Fold direction
  ranked on degree alone, so a node with no facts and no edges won a 0-0 tie
  by id and absorbed a richly-specified work item ("Atlas graph cleanup"
  repeatedly swallowed real PRs). Both proposal paths — deep-dream
  `partition_candidates` and write-time dedup — now rank on `degree + facts`,
  so a fact-rich node is not out-ranked by one stray edge. Equally-thin pairs
  keep the id tie-break, leaving ordinary bare-vs-path proposals intact.
- **Git branch names type as concepts.** `infer_type` returned `None` for
  `feat/lme-v2-pilot`, and unknown types are deliberately neutral, so
  "llama-server *runs-on* a git branch" scored a clean 0.70 and reached the
  cross-project review queue. Branches now type like `master`/`main`, making
  such pairs a hard type violation that is dropped at the source. The rule
  runs after file-extension typing and uses singular prefixes only, so
  `docs/guide/benchmarks.md` and `evals/ladder_sweep.py` stay files.

### Added (2026-07-26 — `relate` action for file/concept duplicate findings)
- **The review queue can now record an edge instead of forcing merge-or-dismiss.**
  A duplicate finding whose two names are a source file and its own bare stem
  (`band.py` ↔ `band`, `evals/dg_shim.py` ↔ `dg_shim`) now carries
  `action: "relate"` plus a `suggested_relation` (default `implements`), with
  the file listed first so the edge reads `<file> implements <concept>`. Backed
  by a new `POST /api/graph/relate` and a Relate button in the Atlas review
  drawer, which writes the edge and then marks the pair distinct.
  **Why:** these pairs are neither duplicates nor unrelated. The concept
  routinely has identity the file does not — an independent runtime (`dream`
  *runs-on* the host shim, `band` *stores-data-in* postgres, both false of the
  module) or several implementing files (`backup.sh` **and** `ops/backup.ps1`
  realize `Backup`, so no single merge is even well-defined). Merging asserts
  false things about the file; dismissing discards a real relationship — and
  dismissal is permanent. The `implements` relation already described exactly
  this case ("a concrete artifact that realizes an abstract role"); only the
  queue's action vocabulary was missing it. Two-source-file pairs
  (`test_shim.py` / `tests/test_shim.py`) and non-code pairs (`README.md` /
  `README`) keep the ordinary merge action.

### Changed (2026-07-26 — gate baseline re-established at 10 replicates; default raised)

> **Superseded 2026-07-27.** Both the baseline and the raised default below
> were undone once the ~0.03 spread they were sized to average away was
> root-caused to the serving stack rather than the judge — see the
> 2026-07-27 entry. The current baseline is n=7 at std 0.0000, and
> `regression_gate.ps1` defaults to `-Replicates 2`. The numbers in this
> entry are historical.

- **`evals/results/regression_gate.baseline.json` re-established on clean
  `origin/master` (commit `959ecad`) with 10 replicates**, replacing the
  3-replicate baseline from 2026-07-18 that both master and the #38–#44
  stack failed. (An 8-replicate baseline landed 45 minutes earlier the same
  day and was replaced by this one before either shipped; this entry
  originally carried that stale `8` in its title.)

  | arm | mean | std | margin |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | rag | 0.5757 | 0.0230 | 0.0460 |
  | cortex | 0.6692 | 0.0319 | 0.0637 |
  | hybrid | 0.7808 | 0.0165 | 0.0330 |

- **`regression_gate.ps1` now defaults to `-Replicates 10`** (was 3).
  Re-establishing alone would not have helped: the next run that forgot
  the flag would have compared a noisy 3-replicate mean against it and
  false-failed again.
- **The old number sat near the top of the range, not the centre.** Across
  **18 honest replicates** of the identical slice (two independent
  establishes, n=8 then n=10): min 0.6154, mean 0.6674, max 0.7179 —
  **13 of 18 fall below the retired 0.7051 and only 1 exceeds it**. A
  baseline frozen near the best observed run makes every honest run
  afterwards look like a regression, which is exactly what happened.
- The two establishes agree to within **0.004 on every arm** (cortex
  0.6651 at n=8, 0.6692 at n=10) — the evidence that the estimate is now
  stable rather than another lucky draw.
- **A zero-variance baseline silently disables the gate's calibration.**
  `make_baseline` sets `margin = max(0.03, 2 x std)`, so the old 0.03 was
  the floor showing through rather than a chosen value. Guarded now by
  `tests/test_regression_gate_defaults.py`, which also pins the default
  replicate count and that the baseline was established at ≥ that count.
- Both earlier runs pass the new baseline on all three arms, including
  the **#38–#44 stack** — the gate obligation on those changes is
  discharged.
- Cost, since the gate re-runs its replicate count every invocation:
  ~3–3.75 min per replicate, **~32–37 min for 10** (measured 28 for 8, 37
  for 10; the spread is host load). At the old n=3 the margin was ~1.2
  standard errors of the difference — roughly a 1-in-5 false-fail rate.
  Note the margin barely moves with N (it is `2 × std`, and std estimates
  a spread that does not shrink); more replicates buy a better estimate of
  the *mean* on both sides.

### Fixed (2026-07-26 — the regression gate's baseline is stale, not the code)
- **`evals/regression_gate.ps1` fails on clean `origin/master`.** Cortex
  **0.6709 ± 0.0370** against a committed baseline of **0.7051**. The
  #38–#44 stack gives **0.6581 ± 0.0196** — **0.0128** from master, well
  inside the noise. The changes did not cause the failure.
- Corroborated three ways. The gate copies the **rag** arm's context
  verbatim, so its two runs have *identical inputs* and still differ by
  **0.021** — that is the judge's noise floor, and it is larger than the
  cortex delta under test. The cortex rebuild path (`rebuild_contexts.py`)
  is plain cosine over dumped fact banks and never touches band retrieval,
  BM25, the recency prior or `detect_contradictions`, so no change in the
  stack can reach it. And `CORTEX_TOP_K` / `CORTEX_MIN_SCORE` are untouched
  by all 90 commits since the baseline.
- **Why the baseline is wrong**: its recorded `std` is exactly **0.0** on
  two arms — three LLM-judge replicates returning identical accuracy —
  where today's runs show 0.007–0.037. It predates
  `LLAMA_ARG_CACHE_RAM=0`, so prompt caching plausibly suppressed the
  variance that has now returned. It also disagrees with `evals/README.md`'s
  own 5-replicate measurement of the same slice, **cortex 0.682 ± 0.017**;
  both of today's runs sit closer to that than to 0.7051.
- **The gate is also under-powered**: a 0.03 margin against a cortex std of
  0.037 at n=3 is ~1.4 standard errors, so it fails a meaningful fraction of
  runs with no change at all. Re-establishing it wants more replicates and a
  margin derived from the measured spread — and deliberate promotion, not a
  side effect of a rerun. **Not re-established here.**
- Both runs committed as evidence:
  `regression_gate-2026-07-26-master-control.agg.json` and
  `regression_gate-2026-07-26-stack-38-44.agg.json`.

### Added (2026-07-26 — embedder comparison on our own corpus)
- **`evals/embedder_recall.py`** ranks every haystack turn of a
  LongMemEval `s` question against the question text and reports recall@k
  of the turns marked `has_answer`, plus an exact paired **McNemar** test
  between backbones. Pure retrieval — no reader, no judge, CPU-only.
- Result (150 questions, 74,183 turns, **299 gold turns**; artifact
  `evals/results/embedder-recall-comparison.json`):

  | backbone | R@5 | R@10 | R@20 | dim |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (shipped) | 0.408 | 0.572 | 0.756 | 384 |
  | `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` | **0.559** | **0.742** | **0.853** | 768 |

  Paired: **+54/−9 at k=5** (p=6e-09), **+60/−9 at k=10** (p=2e-10),
  **+34/−5 at k=20** (p=2e-06). A ~17-point gain at k=10, roughly 6 wins
  per loss.
- Costs, for the migration decision: ~10× CPU encode time (72 ms vs 7 ms
  per text, un-tuned — an ONNX backend is already wired for MiniLM) and 2×
  the stored vector width. `vector(384)` is declared in four tables, so
  adopting it is a schema migration plus a re-embed of every row.
- **A 30-question pilot was discarded as worthless, for two independent
  reasons** worth recording: the machine was busy (invalidating the timing
  column), and the first 30 questions in file order are far easier than the
  corpus — R@5 0.806 there against 0.408 over 150. Near ceiling the two
  backbones look identical; the whole difference was one document. Do not
  take the head of this dataset as a sample.

### Fixed (2026-07-26 — the deploy scripts promised a rollback they hadn't made)
- **`ops/update.ps1` and `ops/update.sh` only print a rollback command when
  the rollback tag actually exists.** Both computed `$rollback`
  unconditionally but only `docker tag`-ged it when a current image was
  found; when it wasn't — a first build, or a version bumped before that
  version was ever built — the tag was skipped with a warning and both exit
  paths printed `docker tag <rollback> <image_tag>` anyway.
- Observed live on 2026-07-26: the deploy warned *"No current
  pseudolife-daemon:0.10.0 image to tag"* and then printed a rollback
  command naming a tag that does not exist. **The unhealthy path is the
  dangerous one** — the operator reaches for that command precisely because
  the deploy just broke, and it fails.
- Now: the no-image case says so explicitly at tag time *and* in the
  rollback block, and offers the path that does work (rebuild the last-good
  ref). The tagged case is unchanged.
- Covered by `tests/test_ops_update_rollback.py`, which drives the real
  script with `docker` and the health probe stubbed as PowerShell
  functions, in both the healthy and unhealthy branches.

### Added (2026-07-25 — supersession on slot identity, not embedding similarity)
- **`detect_contradictions` gained a slot-identity path, checked first.**
  When the new text and an existing entry assert different values — or
  opposite polarities — at the same normalised `(entity, attribute)` slot,
  the old entry is superseded. Deterministic and embedding-free, using the
  same `_norm_key` / `_norm_value` normalisation the cortex uses, so the
  two stores agree on what counts as the same slot.
- Why not cosine: the three existing paths all gate on similarity, which
  is a weak discriminator here. A value swap is a *minimal* edit, so a real
  contradiction is often more embedding-similar than a harmless
  near-duplicate — independent measurement puts cosine at AUROC 0.59 for
  this judgment, barely above chance. The new path reaches corrections at
  any similarity, which is where the cosine-gated paths cannot look at all.
- A matching key with the same value **and** polarity is a restatement, not
  a correction, and is deliberately not flagged — restatements are exactly
  what knowledge-update evidence looks like.
- **Coverage is bounded by slot extraction, which is precision-gated:**
  measured on 6,000 real conversation turns, only **0.63%** yield any slot,
  and the path needs slots on both sides. It therefore targets deliberate
  fact-shaped writes far more than replayed chat, and its reach will grow
  with extractor quality rather than with tuning here.
- Slot extraction now runs **once** per store instead of twice — it was
  being done after the write, and the contradiction scan needs it before.

### Changed (2026-07-25 — writes no longer rescan the bank for possession cues)
- **Contradiction detection caches its gain/loss cue flags per entry.**
  `detect_contradictions` runs over every entry of every band on every
  write, and its state-transition path did four regex-list scans per
  entry before consulting similarity. Profiling a saturated store put
  **94%** of the time there — 1.58M regex searches across five stores —
  against ~4% for the capacity-eviction path that was assumed to be the
  cost. The cue check is that path's early exit, so for the overwhelming
  majority of entries it *is* the work. `MemoryEntry.cue_flags` memoises
  it (transient, never persisted, excluded from equality; sound because
  `text` is never mutated after construction), and the new text's cues are
  hoisted out of the loop.
- Median store latency, real MiniLM embeddings and real conversation text
  (`evals/bench_store_latency.py`, artifact
  `evals/results/store-latency-by-bank-size.json`):

  | resident entries | before | after |
  |---|---|---|
  | 500 | 224 ms | **4.3 ms** |
  | 5,250 (summed capacity) | 1,763 ms | **11.2 ms** |
  | 9,000 (over capacity) | 3,277 ms | **22.5 ms** |

- Cached on the entry rather than in a process-wide LRU deliberately. Path
  3 sweeps the whole bank per write — a cyclic scan, the pathological case
  for LRU, which is 100% hit while the resident set fits and 0% the moment
  it doesn't, with no gradient. An `lru_cache(maxsize=8192)` measured
  identically up to 8,190 resident and then reverted to **1.01x** at
  8,300. The resident set is not reliably bounded (`rebalance_bands`
  leaves the deepest band over capacity rather than truncating at startup,
  and the shipped preset invites raising `max_entries`), so a fixed size
  would have been a cliff. Pinned by a test that would fail on any
  bank-size-dependent warm cost.
- Also rejected: gating the anchor scan on a minimum similarity floor.
  Provably equivalent and worth 5.1x alone, but subsumed by the cue cache
  — and it measured *slower* alongside a process-wide cache, because
  scanning ~24% of the bank per store let resident texts age out. Recorded
  at the call site so it isn't re-attempted blind.

### Fixed (2026-07-25 — restore paths ignored band capacity)
- **`hydrate_cms`, `load()` and the legacy migration now rebalance once.**
  All three append straight to `band.entries`, bypassing `store()` and its
  capacity check, and `hydrate_cms` additionally routes rows whose band no
  longer exists into `bands[0]`. A preset rename could therefore pile the
  whole bank into the 200-slot `working` band — and because every store
  then evicts one entry and appends one, it never drained: the band stayed
  full permanently with every store scanning all of it.
  `ContinuumMemorySystem.rebalance_bands()` walks shallow → deep once,
  spilling each band's lowest-scoring surplus into the next by the same
  retention policy `_evict_one` uses. Measured on the shipped 8-band
  preset: 5,250 rows all stamped with a dead band name seat correctly in
  **0.30 s**, no band over capacity.
- Harmless before 2026-07-25, when capacity eviction deleted and the
  resident set stayed far below capacity (~212 rows against 5,250 on a
  realistic corpus). Demote-on-evict pushed the resident set to the summed
  capacity, which is what made this reachable.
- **The deepest band may finish over capacity** when the bank holds more
  rows than the preset seats. That is deliberate: startup is the wrong
  place to destroy memories the user did not ask to lose. It is logged
  with the count, and drains through the normal eviction path.
- Known cost, not introduced here but now reached sooner: with every band
  saturated, a store cascades an eviction through all eight, each scoring
  its whole band — **~450 ms** at 5,250 resident against ~18 ms at 500.
  The pre-fix pile-up measured ~330 ms but never converged. Reducing that
  scan is tracked separately; a bank near capacity is the only place it
  bites.

### Fixed (2026-07-25 — a failed band move could leave one entry in two bands)
- **`_consolidate` now prunes the source band in a `finally`.** It moved
  entries in a loop but pruned only after finishing, so a raise partway
  through left every already-moved entry live in *both* the source and the
  destination, sharing one `db_id`. Retrieval hid it (dedup is by
  `entry.text`), but `memory_stats` over-counted and the next
  consolidation relocated the stale copy onto the same row. Reproduced at
  4 entries: bands held 6 rows for 4 distinct memories.
- **`_relocate` is all-or-nothing.** It is the shared move primitive for
  promotion *and* for capacity demotion, and both callers prune the source
  on the strength of it returning — so a half-applied move is exactly the
  duplicate above. A failure after the destination append now rolls that
  append back before propagating. (`band.store` itself cannot fail after
  appending — only attribute assignment follows — so the reachable window
  is the provenance copy, which is what the rollback covers.)
- Both were pre-existing; the eviction change earlier today made
  `_relocate` a hot path, which is what made the window worth closing
  rather than narrowing.

### Fixed (2026-07-25 — band overflow destroyed memories; depth was faking recency)
- **Capacity eviction now demotes to the next band instead of deleting.**
  A band at capacity handed its lowest-scoring entry to `/dev/null` along
  with its Postgres row, while the only *other* exit from a band —
  promotion — requires `access_count >= N or surprise > threshold`. So an
  unsurprising, never-retrieved entry died in the 200-slot `working` band
  with ~5,050 slots free behind it. Measured on the LongMemEval `s`
  replay: **31.1% of stored turns discarded at 6.4% total capacity
  utilisation**, `working` saturated in 78/78 questions, `forever` empty
  in all 78. Answer-evidence turns fared *worse* than average (**37.5%
  evicted vs a 31.1% base rate**, with 58% of questions losing at least
  one) because eviction ranks on novelty and knowledge-update evidence is
  a restatement, hence unsurprising by construction. Overflow past the
  deepest band is still a real drop, so summed capacity remains the bound.
- **The depth-ramped recency boost is off by default**
  (`memory.recency_boost_enabled = false`). Retrieval scaled scores by a
  `0.4 → 0.0` ramp over band depth, treating depth as a proxy for age —
  but depth is set by promotion history, which without retrieval to
  accrue access counts tracks surprise rather than age. The ramp could
  therefore rank a weaker match in `working` above a stronger match in a
  deeper band; measured cost up to **18 points on the LongMemEval
  naive-RAG arm**. Set the flag to `true` for the previous ranking.
- **An explicit `min_score` now bounds BM25-only injections.** They enter
  the pool at `weight × normalised_bm25`, bypassing the dense pool's
  relevance gate entirely. The default floor deliberately still does not
  apply to them (injected scores are ≤0.3 at the shipped weight, so 0.25
  would admit only the top lexical hit per query), but a caller-supplied
  floor is a contract over the whole result set.

### Changed (2026-07-25 — BM25 hybrid retrieval is on by default)
- **`memory.bm25.enabled` now defaults to `true`.** The lexical pool
  shipped disabled, so every published retrieval number — including the
  LongMemEval knowledge-update figures and the band ablation — measured
  dense-only retrieval through a 22M-parameter 2021 bi-encoder. It is
  pure stdlib, adds no dependency, and costs ~20–50ms per query at bank
  scale. Opt out with `memory.bm25.enabled = false` or per-call
  `bm25=False`.
### Fixed (2026-07-25 — the llama-server eval crashes, root-caused and fixed)
- **Every eval harness that starts the Qwen judge/answerer now disables
  context checkpoints** (`LLAMA_ARG_CTX_CHECKPOINTS=0`). The fork's
  create/restore/erase churn around the 149.6 MiB recurrent-state
  checkpoints that Qwen 3.6's hybrid Gated-DeltaNet layers trigger per
  task leaked **~285 KV cells per request**, emptying the `-c` pool at a
  rate set by request *count* — hence `decode: failed to find a memory
  slot`, then `GGML_ASSERT(offset + size <= ggml_nbytes(tensor))` and a
  `0xC0000409` abort. Six overnight runs died in a tight 345–377 request
  band; a 600-request soak with checkpoints off passed at 1.7× that, with
  flat latency (1.8–2.2 s), flat VRAM, and zero memory-slot errors.
  Checkpoints buy eval workloads nothing — these prompts are
  full-reprocessed either way, and MTP speed/quality were unchanged.
- `LLAMA_ARG_CACHE_RAM=0` is set alongside it. This was the *first*
  diagnosis and it was **wrong** — the next run crashed six times with
  the cache verifiably disabled. The flag stays only because the prompt
  cache is pure overhead for eval prompts, not because it fixed anything.
- Both are env vars set in each script's `Start-Qwen`, never CLI flags in
  `run-server-turboq.bat`: interactive use of the same server depends on
  warm cache hits.
- Each `Start-Qwen` also archives the previous `qwen-server.log` to
  `crash-logs/` before the `>` redirect truncates it. The abort message
  lives in the tail of the *old* log, which every prior launch destroyed —
  which is a large part of why this took two rounds to root-cause.
- Applied uniformly to all ten harnesses with a `Start-Qwen`:
  `bench_diffusiongemma`, `gate_e4b_ft`, `gate_window`,
  `overnight_longmemeval`, `overnight_qat_ornith`, `overnight_replicates`,
  `regression_gate`, `tonight_bakeoff`, plus `overnight_lme_v2` and
  `overnight_band_wabl`.

### Fixed (2026-07-25 — the V2 reanswer path resumes instead of restarting)
- **`lme_v2_smoke.reanswer` now resumes from its own JSONL** (append +
  skip-done), matching `run_smoke`. It previously opened the output with
  `"w"` and re-read every row from source, so each retry restarted from
  row 1: on 2026-07-25 six server crashes discarded ~29 minutes each and
  turned ~15 minutes of compute into 3.6 hours, with only the single
  crash-free attempt ever producing a file. A crash now costs one
  question.
- **Rows record their `answer_prompt` (`ku` / `compose`), and a resume
  across a prompt change is refused.** Resuming made a mixed-prompt file
  possible where truncation had made it impossible (same `--out-tag`,
  different `--answer-prompt`, half the rows answered under each); the
  run now exits and names the clash. Rows written before the label
  existed are unlabelled and treated as compatible.
  Pinned by `tests/test_lme_v2_smoke_resume.py`.

### Changed (2026-07-25 — the 8-band continuum loses on the write side too)
- **The continuum's last defence is gone.** The 2026-07-19 ablation showed
  the banding earns nothing on *ranking* and left the write side
  (eviction, capacity, cadence) as the remaining case for it. The
  write-side ablation now measured that too — flat INGEST at the
  continuum's total capacity (5,250) vs the stock 8 bands, `s` dataset,
  5 replicates, paired permutation over 78 questions — and the continuum
  **loses**. Write-side isolation (identical flat ranking, only the
  survivor sets differ): hybrid −0.110 p=0.018 (`wall`), −0.108 p=0.027
  (`hist`); rag −0.090/−0.097, n.s. Whole system: all four significant,
  rag −0.274 p=0.0001, hybrid −0.141 p=0.0038. Mechanism: at ~488
  turns/question the 200-entry `working` band overflows faster than
  promotion drains it, so the continuum **evicts 31.1% of everything
  stored** while a flat pool of equal total capacity evicts nothing.
  Bounded honestly in the docs: the flat arm never evicts on this corpus,
  so this measures partition-forced eviction vs none, not one eviction
  *policy* vs another. Published in `docs/guide/benchmarks.md` and
  `evals/README.md`; every delta and p-value pinned to a committed
  artifact by `tests/test_eval_evidence.py`.
- **The LongMemEval-V2 pilot's headline claim is retired.** The
  10-question slice concluded *hybrid beat both single channels in every
  replicate under both prompts*; the complete 74-question `procedure`
  category does not reproduce it — hybrid leads under the default prompt
  (0.243 vs rag 0.162) but **ties naive RAG under the composition-aware
  prompt** (0.284 each). The pilot's ten questions were the first ten in
  dataset file order and proved far easier than the category as a whole
  (every arm roughly halves). Superseded at the site a reader meets it,
  per the retirement rule; the pilot numbers are retained inline as
  history.
  **CORRECTED 2026-08-25 (scorer defect #173):** the full-category
  numbers here are 0.203 vs rag 0.149 (default prompt) and 0.270 vs
  0.257 (composition-aware). The "ties naive RAG" reading was an
  artifact of the defect — corrected it is a 0.013 lead, one question,
  which is still no measurable difference. The retirement itself stands.

### Added (2026-07-24 — write-side band ablation + overnight harness pair)
- **evals**: `band_ablation.py` grew the write-side arm the read-side
  ablation could not express: `replay --band-preset flat` re-runs ingest
  through ONE flat band at the continuum's total capacity (5,250, or
  `--flat-cap`), injected via a `config.yaml` the service reads at
  construction and verified loudly (band count, `surprise_threshold`
  pinned so the arms' configs differ **only** in `memory.miras` —
  `tests/test_band_ablation_flat.py` proves the invariant). `rebuild
  --band-preset flat` emits `wabl-flat-{wall,hist}` answer-phase JSONLs
  plus a survival-stats artifact (per-question stored/survivor counts per
  arm). Only meaningful on the `s` dataset: the 2026-07-24 probe measured
  ~28% of stored turns evicted by the continuum there vs 0% flat, while
  `oracle` (~23 turns/question) never evicts. `--src-tag ""` now
  addresses untagged source runs (previously produced malformed
  double-dash filenames).
- **evals**: overnight harness pair for the two open research threads —
  `overnight_lme_v2.ps1` (full 74-question V2 procedure slice, supervised
  llama-server restarts, JSONL-cursor resume), `overnight_band_wabl.ps1`
  (`-Phase cpu` replays/rebuilds alongside a GPU night on private bench
  DBs; `-Phase answer` for the follow-up GPU window, compares written
  with `--out` artifacts), plus `preflight_overnight.ps1` and
  `overnight_status.ps1` (heartbeat/ledger checks). Runbook:
  `docs/runbooks/overnight-band-wabl-and-lme-v2-slice2.md`.

### Changed (2026-07-21 — the extractor ladder refuses to clobber canonical results)
- **`evals/ladder_sweep.py` never overwrites an existing result file in
  place.** An untagged rerun of a rung whose `evals/results/<rung>.json`
  already exists now exits up front — *before* the hours-long run starts —
  with instructions to pass the new `--out-tag <tag>` flag, which writes
  `<rung>-<tag>.json` alongside the canonical file for deliberate promotion.
  The same guard covers the `--abstain` / `--supersede` sub-sweep outputs.
  This is the code-level enforcement of the "never overwrite a canonical
  result file on a rerun" rule, written after a rerun silently rewrote
  `sonnet-5.json`'s timing fields in place (2026-07-21); pinned by
  `tests/test_eval_ladder_sweep.py`.

### Fixed (2026-07-21 — the auto-started daemon no longer steals foreground focus)
- **`shim.spawn_daemon` now spawns with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`, not
  `DETACHED_PROCESS`.** Both keep the daemon off the caller's console, but
  `DETACHED_PROCESS` leaves the child *needing* a console, and Windows 11
  hands that allocation to the configured default terminal app — Windows
  Terminal then opens a real window that takes foreground. Every shim
  auto-start cost the user a stolen window, in tests and in daily use alike.
- The 2026-07-20 pass (#24) treated this as a test-harness problem and added
  `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` to the three `subprocess.Popen` daemon spawns in
  `test_daemon_http.py` / `test_writer_keying.py`. Those spawns were never
  the source: the windows came from the *shipped* shim, which the suite
  reaches through `test_shim.py`'s three auto-start tests. Instrumenting a
  real suite run with a window watcher attributed all three focus-stealing
  `WindowsTerminal.exe` windows to that one path; a flag matrix over the
  exact `spawn_daemon` call then measured `DETACHED_PROCESS` → 2 visible
  windows per spawn and `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` → 0, with detachment (the child
  outliving its spawner) confirmed intact. Same conclusion
  `ops/install-shim-autostart.ps1` reached live on 2026-07-12 for the Sonnet
  shim — the shipped Python spawner had simply never been brought in line.
- Pinned by two tests in `tests/test_shim.py`: a behavioural one asserting
  the flags `spawn_daemon` actually passes, and a package-wide guard that
  fails on any `DETACHED_PROCESS` *use* in `pseudolife_memory/` (comments
  explaining the choice are tokenized out, so documenting the flag stays
  legal). The guard exists because the previous fix's site-by-site scope is
  exactly what let the real caller slip through.

### Added (2026-07-21 — published benchmark numbers are pinned to committed evidence)
- **`tests/test_eval_evidence.py` fails the suite when a published number has
  no committed artifact behind it.** Every benchmark claim in the README and
  `docs/guide/benchmarks.md` now names the result file it came from, and the
  guard asserts three things: the artifact is git-tracked (a working-copy-only
  file counts as missing, which is exactly what a fresh clone sees), its value
  matches the doc to the published precision, and the guarded doc text still
  exists — without that last check a reword would leave the guard green and
  guarding nothing. Whether a number is *right* still needs a GPU and stays a
  human gate; whether it is *backed* is pure parsing, so it runs here.
- **The band-ablation evidence is now in the repo.** Its significance claim
  (naive RAG under `hist`, −0.090 at p = 0.015) rested on 16 untracked
  replicate files, four tracked base files carrying no scoring fields at all,
  and no comparison artifact whatsoever — one `git checkout .` from being
  unreproducible anywhere. All 40 files plus six generated comparisons are
  committed; every one reproduces the published table exactly.
- **`replicate.py compare` and `lesson_synthesis_bench.py` take `--out`.** Both
  printed their results and forgot them, which is how the `--infer` rung's
  scores reached this changelog with nothing standing behind them. Comparison
  artifacts also record `permutations` and `seed`, without which a permutation
  p-value cannot be re-derived.

### Fixed (2026-07-21 — a double-rounded standard deviation on the front door)
- **The local-ceiling table published `cortex 0.559 ± 0.030`; the aggregate
  says `0.02949…`, which rounds to `0.029`.** Corrected in the README and
  `docs/guide/benchmarks.md`. The evidence guard above found it on its first
  run, against a number nobody had thought to question.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-21 — documented vs enacted: the dream pass learns what your documents prescribe

The dream pass now captures **what a document you shared prescribes** as a
durable fact under that document's subject, kept distinct from what was
actually done — so a runbook's rule and a deploy that skipped it become two
facts, not one blurred into the other. This lands on both extractor tiers
(the bundled E4B sidecar and the Sonnet override prompt), each gated on its
own deployed artifact.

The change came out of a LongMemEval-V2 pilot where every arm scored 0.000
until we found that our own extraction prompt — "extract exactly two kinds
of claim and nothing else" — was making an obedient model silently discard
the protocol documents the answers were drawn from. Also in this release:
the Console's store-curation review panel, deep dream's lesson/world
cross-key duplicate curation, and a hybrid-retrieval default that the same
benchmark work validated (cortex facts ahead of associative recall beat
either channel alone in every replicate).

### Changed (2026-07-21 — Sonnet extractor prompt v2: DOCUMENTS PRESCRIBE)
- **`evals/prompts/sonnet_extractor_v2.md`** — v1 plus one section applying
  the LME-V2 Fix-E lesson to the Sonnet override: what a quoted/summarized
  document (spec, policy, protocol, runbook, guide) prescribes is itself a
  durable fact, extracted under the document's subject even when other notes
  show different enacted behavior. Gated on the ladder `sonnet-5` rung:
  metric-identical to v1 (`gold_recoverable` 1.0, `stale_leak` 0.0, 16/16
  claims — results committed as `ladder-sonnet5-prompt-{v1,v2}.json`), and a
  positive probe confirmed the section fires (documented rule + divergent
  enacted behavior extracted as separate facts). The autostart installers
  (`install-shim-autostart.ps1`/`.sh`) and install-script hints now default
  to v2; running deployments pick it up by re-running the autostart
  installer (or restarting the shim with the v2 `--system-prompt-file`).

### Changed (2026-07-20 — extraction prompt learns the LME-V2 lessons; hybrid default pinned)
- **The shipped extraction prompt (`_SYSTEM_PROMPT`) now names document
  prescriptions as extractable and carries a worked example.** Two transfers
  from the LongMemEval-V2 arc: (1) a scope-restricted extraction prompt makes
  an obedient model silently discard content classes it doesn't name — the
  prompt now states that what a shared DOCUMENT (spec, policy, protocol,
  runbook, guide) prescribes is itself a durable fact, distinct from what the
  session did; (2) small extractors follow a demonstrated format far more
  reliably than imperative instructions — a compact worked example shows a
  current-state update plus a `documented requirement` claim. Gated on the
  ladder's `e4b-ft` rung (the deployed Arm-1 student): `gold_recoverable`
  1.0 → 1.0, `stale_leak` 0.0 → 0.0, extract time flat — and claim output got
  *cleaner* (16 claims / 16 inserts vs the baseline's 26 claims for the same
  16 inserts; the example removed redundant duplicates). The datagen path
  reads the same constant, so the next distillation cycle trains on the new
  prompt automatically. `extractor_max_tokens` stays 2048 — the LME-V2 A/B
  showed 4096 scores worse (extra deliberation rope hurts small models more
  than truncation).
- **Hybrid retrieval's defaults are now test-pinned** (`cortex.enabled` and
  `cortex.search_first` both `True`, new `tests/test_hybrid_default.py`). The
  LME-V2 procedure-slice replicates showed the hybrid context beating both
  single channels in every replicate under both answer prompts; the defaults
  were already correct — the pin makes flipping them a deliberate,
  test-visible decision.

### Changed (2026-07-20 — LongMemEval-V2 Fix E: documented-protocol extraction + answer-format anchoring)
- **LME-V2 smoke: third extraction claim kind — DOCUMENTED PROTOCOL** (evals-only).
  Fix D put the article body in front of the extractor, but the Fix-B trajectory
  prompt said "exactly two kinds of claim and nothing else" (click-path
  workflows + affordances), so the extractor *correctly* discarded document
  prose — and `procedure` gold answers follow the documented protocol
  (Reports → Problems), not the agent's enacted clicks (Knowledge Search →
  Problems). `[article]` notes now yield an
  `entity=<protocol title> / attribute='documented procedure (modules in
  order)'` claim mapping prose steps to canonical navigator module names.
- **Compose answer prompt: protocol authority + worked example + headroom.** A
  named protocol's documented procedure is declared authoritative over enacted
  click-paths; the format section now cooperates with the benchmark's own
  `\boxed{}` convention (the scorer extracts boxed text first) instead of
  forbidding explanations qwen ignored anyway, anchored by a tiny worked
  example showing duplicate-module dropping and boxed termination; compose
  answers get `max_tokens=2048` (256 truncated mid-reasoning).
- **Result (question `025db8ef`, full 100-trajectory haystack, bm25+rerank+
  lexical-cortex):** all three arms flip 0.000 → **1.000** on both the
  deterministic scorer and the judge (`fixe-compose3` tag). Cortex/hybrid
  answer straight from the documented-procedure fact in 3–4 s; rag composes
  the same answer from raw task turns in ~25 s. The n=1 diagnosis chain is
  closed; next step is the wider procedure-question slice.
- **10-question procedure slice (`slice1` / `slice1-compose` tags,
  bm25+rerank+lexical-cortex, 100-trajectory haystacks):** deterministic
  accuracy KU prompt rag 0.30 / cortex 0.30 / **hybrid 0.60**; compose prompt
  rag 0.50 / cortex 0.30 / **hybrid 0.70** — from 0.00 across every arm
  before Fixes A–E. Hybrid ≥ both single channels on both prompts; V2
  procedure hybrid 0.70 is in line with the V1 knowledge-update hybrid oracle
  (0.705 — a since-retired unreplicable single run; the replicated band is
  0.695 ± 0.017, see the 2026-07-18 entry below). One llama-server crash mid-run (WinError 10054) was caught by the
  probe-gated abort and the run resumed losslessly from its per-question
  JSONL cursor.
- **3-replicate aggregate (`slice1` / `-r2` / `-r3`, `slice1.agg.json`):**
  KU prompt rag 0.300 [0.30–0.30] / cortex 0.167 [0.00–0.30] / **hybrid
  0.533 [0.50–0.60]**; compose prompt rag 0.500 [0.40–0.60] / cortex 0.233
  [0.10–0.30] / **hybrid 0.633 [0.60–0.70]**.
  (**CORRECTED 2026-08-25, scorer defect #173** — re-scored:
  KU rag 0.300 / cortex 0.167 / **hybrid 0.500 [0.40–0.60]**; compose rag
  0.433 [0.40–0.50] / cortex 0.200 [0.10–0.30] / **hybrid 0.533
  [0.50–0.60]**. One compose replicate becomes a tie with rag, so the
  "every replicate" claim below is corrected to "every mean".)
  Hybrid beats both single
  channels in every replicate under both prompts; rag is the most stable
  arm, cortex the most run-to-run volatile (extraction nondeterminism —
  llama-server generation varies across runs even at temperature 0). A
  4096-token answer A/B (`slice1-compose4k`) scored WORSE than 2048 (hybrid
  0.60 vs 0.70) — extra deliberation rope hurts more than truncation; the
  compose cap stays 2048. Remaining failure classes are content-class
  limits, not harness bugs: form-field-inventory MC (`07ffeedf`),
  click-level navigation-detail MC (`100ff132` — detail the extraction
  prompt deliberately drops as non-durable), and cross-workflow comparison
  with non-converging deliberation (`4df5e6b4`). llama-server died 4× across
  the replicate campaign (~60–90 min sustained-ingest pattern); every crash
  was caught by the probe-gated abort and resumed losslessly.

### Changed (2026-07-20 — LongMemEval-V2 Fix D: capture knowledge-article body text)
- **LME-V2 adapter now captures ServiceNow KB *article body text*** (evals-only;
  no product behavior change). Fix A distilled each state to title + landmark
  labels + resolved action and deliberately dropped body StaticText — but some
  `procedure` gold answers are grounded in the BODY of a "Company Protocols"
  knowledge article (e.g. "Agent Workload Balancing" prescribes "...access the
  list of reports... Re-assign the ... problem..."), so that prescription never
  entered the corpus and no extractor could recover it.
  `trajectory_to_turns(include_observations=True)` now detects article pages (a
  `RootWebArea` titled "… Knowledge Portal" that carries an `article` role node —
  matches exactly the five article pages across all 200 small-tier trajectories,
  excludes every "Knowledge Search"/"Knowledge Home" chrome page) and emits each
  distinct article's body ONCE per trajectory as a framed `[article] <title>:
  <body>` turn, appended right after the step where it first opened. Body text
  is the `article` subtree's StaticText/heading/link names in document order
  (links stay interleaved so sentences read coherently; repr-style quoting with
  escaped apostrophes is parsed correctly), boilerplate (KB number / "Authored
  by" / views / "Copy Permalink") dropped, capped at `article_chars` (1500).
  Gated by the new `include_article_body` flag (default on; rides the
  observations path). For question `025db8ef` (full 100-trajectory haystack) the
  phrase "list of reports" goes 0 → 1 and "Re-assign" 2 → 4, at 1.005× the Fix-A
  corpus (article pages are rare — 8 turns over 5 articles). New
  `evals/lme_v2_check_fixd.py` gates the corpus rebuild offline (CPU-only).

### Changed (2026-07-19 — LongMemEval-V2 pilot CPU fixes: trajectory ingest recovers gold labels)
- **`OpenAICompatExtractor` gained an optional `system_prompt` argument**
  (default `None` → the shipped `_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, so the daemon and every
  product path stay byte-identical). Off-label harnesses can now supply a
  domain-specific base extraction prompt while still getting the vocab /
  known-facts hints appended. Used by the LME-V2 smoke's trajectory-mode prompt.
- **LME-V2 evals harness (`evals/lme_v2_*`) — three post-mortem fixes** (all
  evals-side; no product behavior change beyond the extractor arg above):
  *Fix A* — `trajectory_to_turns(include_observations=True)` no longer dumps raw
  `accessibility_tree`s (which were ~47× the baseline corpus and, being opaque
  bids, contained **zero** occurrences of the gold module names). It distils
  each state into a resolved action label (bid → node role+name, resolved
  against the pre-action tree) plus a capped page context (title + headers). For
  question `025db8ef` the gold term "Problems" goes 0 → 10 occurrences at 1.43×
  the baseline size. *Fix B* — a trajectory-mode extraction prompt that pulls the
  ordered workflow + environment affordances instead of durable user facts.
  *Fix C* — a cross-trajectory synthesis pass clustering same-task procedure
  claims into a canonical "typical workflow" fact, weighting `outcome=success`
  over `failure`. New `evals/lme_v2_check0.py` gates the corpus rebuild.

### Added (2026-07-19 — Console: store-curation review panel in the Atlas drawer)
- **The lesson/world duplicate listings are now reviewable in the Console.**
  The Atlas Review drawer gains a "Store curation" panel rendering each
  `lesson_duplicates` / `world_duplicates` pair with both sides'
  entity/attribute/value (plus polarity/outcome/about for lessons and a
  scheme-guarded `source_url` link for world facts) and a confirm-gated
  "Mark distinct" button posting to `POST /api/curation/dismiss-duplicate`.
  Backed by a new standing `GET /api/curation/duplicates` (service
  `curation_duplicates`) that computes the same pairs as the deep dream —
  shared listing helper, so thresholds/dismissals can't drift — without the
  graph-wide dream pass, so the drawer loads them on demand and dismissals
  take effect immediately. Only the distinct verdict is actionable in the
  UI; true duplicates are still settled agent-side via `memory_forget`
  (nothing is ever auto-deleted).

### Added (2026-07-19 — deep dream: lesson/world cross-key duplicate curation)
- **`memory_dream(action="deep")` now lists curation candidates for the
  lesson and world stores** — `lesson_duplicates` / `world_duplicates` in
  both dry-run and apply responses. Dedup/supersession in those stores is
  strictly per-slot (`(task, aspect)` / `(entity, attribute)`), so
  near-duplicates parked under different keys accumulated silently (a
  2026-07-19 manual sweep found 6 duplicate lesson groups and 1 duplicate
  world slot). The new `graph_consolidation.slot_duplicate_candidates`
  reuses the deep dream's cosine candidate-pair approach over the records'
  own embeddings (floor/cap via the new `memory.deep_dream`
  `curation_min_similarity` = 0.80 / `curation_top_k` = 20). Listing-only:
  nothing is auto-deleted — duplicates are settled with the existing
  `memory_forget` tools, and genuinely-distinct pairs are dismissed via the
  new `memory_graph_review(action="dismiss_slot_pair")` /
  `POST /api/curation/dismiss-duplicate` (service
  `curation_dismiss_duplicate`), persisted in the existing
  `dismissed_pairs` table under a `lesson:`/`world:` namespace (safe
  because `graph.norm_name` strips `:` while every curation row carries a
  colon-bearing prefix, so graph-name dismissals can't collide; literal
  `|` in a slot component is folded to `-` to keep the joined key
  unambiguous; no schema change).

### Changed (2026-07-19 — installer no longer prompts for the CLAUDE.md block)
- **The standing memory-loop block is opt-in, not a prompt.** The installer's
  "Append the memory-loop block?" question (default Y) double-injected: the
  session-hook briefing already delivers the byte-identical block every
  session, so accepting the default cost ~60 duplicated lines of context per
  session. The interactive prompt is removed; the default is skip, with the
  one-liner printed for anyone who wants the standing copy. Explicit
  `--instructions append` / `-Instructions append` (and the `--claude-md` /
  `-ClaudeMd` compatibility aliases) still write it — useful for subagent
  visibility (subagents read CLAUDE.md but not hook output) and hook-less
  setups. i18n source bumped to v5 for the quickstart-narrative change.

### Fixed (2026-07-19 — analyzer: pruned-edge lesson entities leave the unattributed queue)
- **The graph analyzer's "entities with no project" finding now also excludes
  entities referenced by `lessons.entity_id`/`object_entity_id`** — the
  residual tail of the 0.9.0 lesson-entity exclusion. That exclusion keyed on
  edge signal (all edges `prefers`/`avoids`), so lesson entities whose lesson
  edges were pruned by hygiene carry ZERO edges and stayed flagged (4 on the
  live bank). The service now passes the lesson-referenced id set from
  storage into the analyzer, which stays DB-free.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-19

### Changed (2026-07-19 — analyzer: lesson entities leave the unattributed queue)
- **The graph analyzer's "entities with no project" finding now excludes
  lesson-only entities** — task/approach nodes minted by `memory_outcome`
  whose every edge is a `prefers`/`avoids` lesson relation. They carry no
  fact traces or mentions, so the mention-scan can never attribute them;
  flagging them was permanent review-queue noise (~137 on the live bank).
  Entities that also carry normal relations still flag as before.

### Fixed (2026-07-19 — spurious extractor fallback + its visibility)
- **The sonnet shim's `/health` is stale-while-revalidate** — the actual root
  cause of the spurious fallbacks (the restart correlation was a red
  herring): on cache expiry (5-min TTL) `/health` ran a REAL `claude -p`
  completion taking seconds, while the daemon probes with a 3s timeout, so
  any dream arriving after an idle period hit the stale cache, timed out,
  and silently fell back (3/3 live dreams). A stale cache now answers
  instantly with the last verdict and refreshes in a background thread; the
  startup path warms the cache before the server accepts connections, so no
  request ever hits the blocking empty-cache branch. (Requires a shim
  restart to take effect.)
- **The auto-mode extractor probe retries once** (2s apart) before falling
  back — belt-and-braces for genuinely transient probe failures.
- **The Console's extractor chip now warns when the LAST dream ran on the
  fallback** even though the primary is healthy again — previously that state
  rendered the green "primary ✓" chip with the fallback run visible only in
  the hover tooltip, so silent degradation stayed silent.

### Changed (2026-07-19 — dream graphing: provenance stamping + typed-relation prompt)
- **Dream-minted relation entities now carry project provenance.** Entities
  CREATED while linking a dream batch's relations are stamped into
  `entity_sources` with the batch's entry sources (scopes policy applied via
  the new shared `ScopesConfig.scope_keys()`: case-fold, exclusions, umbrella
  rollup; `origin='derived'`). Relation endpoints have no fact traces, so the
  backfill could never attribute them after the fact — they were the bulk of
  the "entities with no project" review finding. The stamp also feeds the
  cross-project gate within the same batch, so a freshly minted entity from
  project A linking to a project-B entity is routed to review like any other
  cross-project claim. Follow-up fix (caught in live verification):
  `dream_pull` entry dicts now carry `source` — they didn't, so `dream_run`
  silently passed an empty source set and nothing was stamped; regression
  pinned by an end-to-end `dream_run` test.
- **The relations extraction prompt no longer invites `related-to`.** The old
  tail ("if a real connection fits none of the specific ones, use
  'related-to'") was the source of the untyped co-mention faucet the
  quarantine diverts. The prompt now demands the most specific listed
  relation, restricts `related-to` to explicitly-stated connections, and
  instructs skipping pairs that merely appear together in the same note.

### Changed (2026-07-19 — installer wires Codex through the stdio shim)
- **Shim mode now applies to both clients.** The installer's Codex branch
  registered plain HTTP unconditionally, so an installer-wired Codex was
  exactly the "second client with no identity of its own" the session-
  identity docs warn about — while a Claude Code session's hook pointer is
  fresh, Codex writes attribute to Claude's episode (tier 3). `--transport
  shim` (the default) now wires Codex as `codex mcp add pseudolife-memory
  -- pseudolife-mcp`, giving each Codex session its own tier-1
  `X-PL-Session` identity; HTTP remains the fallback when no shim tooling
  exists and the explicit `--transport http` choice. The shim install is
  memoized so `--client both` runs pipx/pip once. (In the PowerShell
  installer the shim block became a function — every native command in it
  pipes to `Out-Host`, since a PS function's return value would otherwise
  absorb pipx/pip output and make a failed install read as success at the
  call site.)

### Changed (2026-07-19 — graph hygiene round 2: scope purge, nested topics, edge quarantine)
- **`backfill_entity_sources` now purges contaminated derived scope rows** on
  every run: sources in `memory.scopes.exclude` and legacy mixed-case scope
  keys are deleted (`origin='derived'` only — manual assignments are never
  touched). Previously the backfill only upserted, so an excluded meta tag
  re-inserted once (e.g. by pre-scope-policy code) stayed a "project" forever.
  Benign stale derived rows are deliberately kept: attribution must not decay
  when retention prunes the entries it was derived from.
- **`/api/graph/projects` is rollup-aware**: a source mapped to an umbrella in
  `memory.scopes.rollup` now carries `parent` (additive field), and the
  Console's project switcher nests children under their umbrella (`↳` prefix)
  instead of rendering the family as flat peers.
- **Low-confidence dream edges are quarantined to `edge_proposals`** instead
  of the live graph: edges scoring below the new
  `memory.dream.relation_quarantine_below` (default 0.5) file a review
  proposal (`source="dream-low-confidence"`). At the default this catches
  exactly the untyped `related-to` co-mention edges (confidence 0.45), which
  were entering the live graph at ~19/day (dubious-edge findings 34 → 120 in
  four days). Typed clean edges (0.70) are unaffected; `0.0` disables the
  quarantine and restores write-live behavior.

### Fixed (2026-07-19 — concurrent test runs no longer terminate each other)
- **Two overlapping `pytest tests/` invocations produced 15–170 nondeterministic
  `psycopg.errors.AdminShutdown` failures/errors with a different victim set
  every run** — `pg_conn` (and evals' `reset_bench()`) reap every other backend
  on their database before truncating, and both runs shared one
  `pseudolife_memory_test` / `pseudolife_memory_bench`, so each run's reaper
  killed the other run's live connections. Each pytest process now provisions
  private per-run databases (`pseudolife_memory_test_<pid>`,
  `pseudolife_memory_bench_<pid>`), dropped at exit, with dead-run leftovers
  pruned on the next run (pid-liveness-checked, so live concurrent runs are
  never touched). `PSEUDOLIFE_TEST_DATABASE_URL` still wins verbatim (CI), and
  eval CLI runs keep the fixed bench name (`PSEUDOLIFE_BENCH_DB` is only pinned
  by the test suite). Regression pins in `tests/test_pg_run_isolation.py`.

### Changed (2026-07-19 — plugin no longer bundles the MCP server)
- **The Claude Code plugin is now the hooks + commands layer only**: its
  `.mcp.json` (HTTP server entry) is removed. Claude Code loads a plugin
  MCP server *alongside* any user-registered server for the same daemon —
  no deduplication, no per-server disable (only the whole-plugin toggle,
  which would also kill the identity/briefing hooks) — so plugin + installer
  users carried a doubled tool namespace in every session. The MCP transport
  is now always registered by `ops/install.*` (stdio shim by default, HTTP
  with `--transport http`) or the README's `claude mcp add` one-liner; the
  installer's plugin-detected branch still skips the hook and CLAUDE.md
  wiring but no longer skips the transport step. **Migration (existing
  plugin users):** after the plugin updates, run the installer once (or the
  one-liner) to register the transport — and if you had both before, the
  duplication disappears on its own.

### Fixed (2026-07-19 — resume-after-reap fragmentation on the hook path)
- **A SessionStart re-fire after the idle reaper no longer forks the
  episode.** Resume-on-return (reopen a recently-reaped session root instead
  of leaving a husk) lived only in the store path, so when the idle reaper
  closed a long session's root and Claude Code then re-fired SessionStart
  (source `resume`/`compact`), the hook path (`episode_start_session`) opened
  a *second* root for the same session — fragmenting one logical session
  across two episodes (and feeding the zero-signal outcome-inference scan a
  spurious candidate). Both paths now share one `_resume_closed_session_locked`
  helper, so a return via either resumes the same root within
  `PSEUDOLIFE_SESSION_RESUME_SECONDS` (default 6 h; `0` disables).

### Fixed (2026-07-19 — active-session pointer TTL)
- **A crashed client's tier-3 pointer no longer misattributes forever.** The
  machine-scoped active-session pointer (identity tier 3) is set at
  SessionStart and cleared at SessionEnd — but a client that crashes never
  fires SessionEnd, so its pointer used to attract every later handle-less
  direct-HTTP write until the next SessionStart overwrote it. The pointer now
  expires: tier-3 resolution ignores one older than
  `PSEUDOLIFE_ACTIVE_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` (default `21600` = 6 h, matching the
  resume window; `0` disables), falling through to the transport/idle-gap
  floor. Refresh is on-set only (SessionStart, which Claude Code re-fires on
  resume/compact); a legacy pointer with no stored timestamp reads as stale
  and is ignored until re-registered, never a crash.

### Added (2026-07-19 — band-ablation offline rebuild)
- **evals**: `evals/band_ablation.py` — 8-band continuum vs single-table
  retrieval ablation as an offline context rebuild (2026-07-17 architecture
  critique). `replay` re-ingests each LongMemEval-KU question's haystack
  turns CPU-only (real `svc.store` path, dreaming skipped) and serialises
  full band state per question; `rebuild` re-ranks the rag/hybrid raw-turn
  selection from that state under two policies (`continuum` mirrors the
  CMS Pool-1 depth-modulated recency ranking plus the slot channel;
  `flat` is one pool with a single depth-0 recency term) × two timestamp
  modes (`wall` = served regime, age≈0; `hist` = session-date timestamps
  ranked from the question date, making the half-life continuum real),
  emitting four `arm1-abl-*` JSONLs ready for `replicate.py`. Sanity gate:
  the continuum+wall mirror re-selects the originally served rag context
  at 1.000 agreement across all 78 questions.

### Changed (2026-07-19 — project-scope hygiene)
- **Scope derivation policy** (`memory.scopes` config): the entity-sources
  backfill now case-folds scope keys (`Pseudolife` and `pseudolife` are one
  scope), skips meta source tags that must never become projects
  (`scopes.exclude`, default `status`/`claude`/`agent`/`correction`), and
  writes an additional umbrella scope for sources mapped in `scopes.rollup`
  (both rows kept — family view and fine-grained filter coexist). Previously
  every distinct `entries.source` string minted its own Atlas project,
  fragmenting one project family across many scopes.

### Changed (2026-07-19 — session identity contract)
- **Episodes no longer key on the transport connection.** Five-tier
  identity: shim `X-PL-Session` → explicit `episode` handle on write tools
  (advertised in the session briefing) → hook-registered session (SessionStart
  now forwards Claude Code's `session_id`; new SessionEnd hook closes the
  episode promptly) → legacy `mcp-session-id` (removed from MCP 2026-07-28,
  SEP-2567) → writer+idle-gap floor. A session can no longer close another
  session's episode (`episode_end` ownership guard). The installer now wires
  the stdio shim by default (`--transport http` to opt out) — per-session
  identity for concurrent sessions.

### Fixed (2026-07-19 — hook mutation paths honor the bearer gate)
- **`GET /api/hook/session-start` and `POST /api/hook/session-end` mutated
  state without the bearer-token check when `PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_TOKEN` is
  configured** — session-start only used `_authorized(scope)` to gate the
  briefing *content*, not the `?session_id=` episode registration / active-
  session pointer write, and session-end never checked it at all. On a
  LAN-exposed token-gated daemon this let an unauthenticated client hijack
  the active-session pointer (misattributing untagged writes) or
  force-close sessions. Fixed: session-start now drops `session_id`/`source`
  entirely when unauthorized (output stays byte-identical to the
  instructions-only response — no registration, no advertisement); session-
  end now returns 401 (same shape as `/api`'s gate) when a token is
  configured and the bearer is missing/wrong. ASGI-level regression coverage
  added in `tests/test_session_identity.py` (there was none before, in
  either direction).

### Fixed (2026-07-19 — session identity: header+handle attribution)
- **`memory_store` / `memory_fact_set` / `memory_outcome` attribution is now
  unconditional on a valid `episode` handle, even when a header session
  (`X-PL-Session` / `set_writer_context` override) is also present** — per
  the design contract's "Precedence rationale" (`docs/superpowers/specs/
  2026-07-18-session-identity-contract-design.md`), the header wins
  *identity* but the write must still attribute to the handle's episode.
  `MemoryService.store()` previously wrote its attribution override to
  `self._cms.bands[0].entries[-1]` **after** `CMS.store()` returned — but
  `CMS.store()` runs its promotion walk internally before returning, and
  promotion builds a **new** `MemoryEntry` object in the destination band
  (`CMS._consolidate`), so a promoted entry silently kept the header
  session's lazily-opened episode instead of the handle's. Fixed by adding
  `CMS.store(..., attribution_episode_id=...)`, applied to the entry
  immediately after the session-key stamp and before both the write-through
  insert and the promotion walk, so it lands in the persisted row and
  survives promotion. `record_outcome` already attributed unconditionally
  (`resolved[0] if resolved is not None else ...`, no header check) and
  needed no change; pinned with a regression test regardless.

### Removed (2026-07-18 — neural-era residue sweep)
- **`pseudolife_memory/memory/contrastive.py` deleted** — the
  `ContrastiveUpdater` / `NegativeSignalDetector` classes were constructed
  nowhere on any daemon path (the zombie sweep noted this at
  `service.py:541-543`); verified unreferenced anywhere in code, tests, or
  docs before removal. `ContrastiveConfig` (the config dataclass consumers
  actually touch) lives in `pseudolife_memory/utils/config.py` and is
  untouched.
  `pseudolife_memory/memory/context_builder.py` was checked against the same
  claim but is **not** dead — `service.py` imports its `_relative_time`
  helper and `pseudolife_memory/memory/__init__.py` re-exports
  `ContextBuilder` — so it was kept.
  **Superseded 2026-07-30** (see the `[Unreleased]` dead-code sweep): both
  claims in the two paragraphs above were wrong or have since lapsed.
  `ContrastiveConfig` had **no** consumers — deleting `contrastive.py` took
  the last one, and nothing re-read the config dataclass; it is now removed.
  `ContextBuilder` was kept on the strength of a re-export that was itself
  the only reference — the class is now removed and only `_relative_time`
  survives in `context_builder.py`.
- **`pseudolife_memory/memory/miras/retention.py` docstrings corrected** —
  the module and factory docstrings described `weight_decay` as "gradient
  shrinkage of the memory weights" applied during an update step that no
  longer exists post-v0.5. Rewritten to say plainly that `weight_decay` is
  vestigial (kept only for factory-signature parity), matching the honest
  framing `RetentionPolicy` in `protocols.py` already carried. No behavior
  changed.
  `pseudolife_memory/memory/titans_memory.py` was audited against the same
  claim: it already documents plainly that the TITANS neural memory is gone
  and the file only hosts the `MemoryEntry` / `RetrievalResult` dataclasses,
  so no edit was needed there.
  Archive pointer for all removed neural machinery: branch
  `archive/neural-memory-titans`.

### Security (2026-07-18 — mcp 1.28.1, Dependabot alert 5)
- **`mcp` bumped 1.28.0 → 1.28.1 in `ops/requirements.lock.txt`**
  (CVE-2026-59950 / GHSA-vj7q-gjh5-988w, high: the SDK's WebSocket server
  transport accepted requests without Host/Origin validation). The daemon
  serves streamable HTTP only and never mounts the WebSocket transport, so
  the vulnerable path was unreachable — taken anyway as a clean patch bump:
  no transitive pin moves, and every 1.28.1 constraint is already satisfied
  by the existing lockfile pins.

### Fixed (2026-07-18 — client-neutrality follow-ups)
- **The `agent` default source no longer hijacks derived session titles** —
  it joins `claude` in the title vote's noise set, so real project sources
  keep winning the dominant-source vote (it still wins when it's all there
  is). The service-layer `store()` default now matches the MCP surface
  (`agent`, was `claude`).
- **`docs/guide/configuration.md` writer row updated** for the
  client-selectable compose default (`mcp-client`), including the migration
  note for pre-selector installs whose tier map keys on `claude-code`.

### Added (2026-07-18 — client-neutral MCP guidance)
- **The MCP initialization now advertises the memory workflow through the
  protocol's `instructions` field** — clients that honor server instructions,
  including Codex, learn the recall/capture/outcome loop without relying on a
  Claude-specific standing-instructions file. Package and registry descriptions
  now describe MCP-compatible agents rather than a single client.
- **Default tool attribution is no longer Claude-specific** — unsourced MCP
  stores use `source="agent"`. Existing memories and explicit `source` values
  are unchanged.

### Added (2026-07-18 — Codex install parity)
- **The one-shot installers now support `claude`, `codex`, or `both` clients**
  (`--client` / `-Client`) while preserving Claude as the compatibility
  default. Preflight checks only the selected client CLI; MCP registration uses
  each client's native HTTP command; and the optional standing memory block is
  offered for Claude's `CLAUDE.md` and Codex's `AGENTS.md`.
- **The existing briefing hook now installs into Codex too** — the hook helpers
  target either `~/.claude/settings.json` or `~/.codex/hooks.json`. Both clients
  accept the same `SessionStart` `additionalContext` payload, so briefing
  generation remains a single implementation.
- **Container installs now register a briefing command that actually exists** —
  the hook runs `pseudolife-mcp briefing` inside the daemon container. The old
  one-shot flow wrote a host command without installing the host package, so
  fresh Docker-only installs silently missed every session briefing.
- **Installer-managed daemon provenance reflects the selected client** — writer
  IDs use `claude-code`, `codex`, or `mcp-client` for a shared install.

### Changed (2026-07-18 — outcome-inference abstention hardening)
- **The inference prompt now requires an attempt-with-result before
  claiming an outcome**: read-only/note-taking sessions and deferred
  decisions abstain instead of inventing signals, and the
  correction-vs-failure boundary is explicit (an approach failing on its
  own is failure; correction requires the user correcting the assistant).
  Bundled-sidecar (E4B) score on the `--infer` rung: 0.562 → 0.875 with
  both abstention fixtures passing; Sonnet primary unregressed
  (~0.90 over 3 runs). Bench matcher now grounds expected keywords
  against `task`+`about` (both schema-compliant phrasings accepted).

### Added (2026-07-18 — auto-outcome inference at episode close)
- **The daemon now infers outcome signals for silent sessions**: when a
  session episode closes with stored entries but zero `memory_outcome`
  calls (35% of real sessions, measured 2026-07-18), a new dream stage
  infers up to 3 signals (`origin="inferred"`) from the episode's own
  record — including status-source entries — and the same dream
  synthesizes lessons from them at confidence 0.4 (vs 0.6 explicit).
  Cursor + bounded retry live in `meta` (no schema change).
  `dream_status` gains an `infer_outcomes` block and `would_fire` counts
  pending inference. Kill switch: `memory.lessons.infer_outcomes: false`.

### Changed (2026-07-18 — Arm-1 deploy evidence downgraded by replication)
- **First replicated LongMemEval-KU comparison** (5 replicates/config,
  paired permutation test, n=78): the shipped Arm-1 fine-tuned extractor's
  cortex gain is +0.080 at **p = 0.17** (pre-registered threshold 0.05 —
  not confirmed; the single-run "+0.102" was inflated), and the hybrid arm
  shows no measurable benefit (p = 0.83). Default stays (point estimate
  positive, no evidence of harm) but is flagged for revisit. The untagged
  `qwen-27b` 0.705 headline run predates context persistence and is
  unreplicable; its replicable sibling (`w0`) scores hybrid 0.695 ± 0.017.
  Docs renumbered accordingly (`docs/guide/benchmarks.md`,
  `evals/README.md`).

### Added (2026-07-18 — eval replication layer + regression gate)
- **evals**: `evals/replicate.py` — answer-phase replication over
  `longmemeval_bench.py` (`spawn`/`run`/`agg`/`compare`/`gate-check`/
  `baseline`): stripped `-rN` replicate files, mean±std aggregation to
  `.agg.json`, paired permutation compare. Measured motivation: identical
  configs vary ~7.7 pp cortex accuracy run-to-run (judge-side noise), wider
  than several previously-published single-run deltas.
- **evals**: `evals/regression_gate.ps1` (pinned replicated `arm1-gate`
  slice vs committed `regression_gate.baseline.json`; covers
  retrieval/serving/judging — the ladder still covers extraction) and
  `evals/overnight_replicates.ps1` (Arm-1 re-verification, pre-registered
  p < 0.05 rule).
- **docs**: variance/replication methodology in `evals/README.md`; honesty
  note in `docs/guide/benchmarks.md` (single-run numbers carry a ~7.7 pp
  noise band).

### Fixed (2026-07-16 — deterministic `recent` ordering on same-tick stores)
- **`recent` now tie-breaks entries whose wall-clock timestamps collide**
  within one `time.time()` tick. Each `MemoryEntry` carries a transient
  process-monotonic creation sequence (`seq` — not persisted; hydration
  re-stamps in insertion order), preserved across band promotion, and
  `recent` sorts by `(timestamp, seq)` descending. Previously same-tick
  stores listed in effectively arbitrary order (stable sort + promotion
  relocations), which flaked `recent`-ordering assertions under load.

### Added (2026-07-16 — Console loop-health tile)
- **Observatory "Loop health" panel**: windowed (7d vs prior 7d) stores and
  outcome-signal counts with trend arrows and a success/failure/correction
  breakdown, session count, per-session rates, pending signals, and
  last-lesson recency — the measurement side of the memory-loop
  instructions. Head chip flags "no outcomes logged" when the REFLECT beat
  isn't firing. Data: new `loop_health` on `PostgresStorage` (indexed
  COUNT queries; consumed signals still count — retention is the only
  eraser) wrapped by `MemoryService.loop_health` (`{"available": false}`
  without Postgres), surfaced as `loop` in `/api/overview`.

### Added (2026-07-16 — cold-bank onboarding in the session-start hook)
- `/api/hook/session-start` appends a short seeding guide when the bank is
  provably empty (`total_memories == 0`): name the session, store a few
  durable facts, set one canonical value, log the first outcome. Warm
  banks, stats failures, and unauthorized token-gated requests never see
  it — onboarding noise on a working bank is worse than none on a cold one.

### Changed (2026-07-16 — richer memory-loop instructions + per-user override)
- **The served memory-loop instructions are now the full three-beat loop**
  (RECALL / CAPTURE / REFLECT with the hard-won operational details: the
  `fact_get` null-slot footgun, `superseded_by_text` handling, session
  titling, sub-episodes, `source="status"` routing, the surprise-gate note,
  a new *never store secrets* rule, and a `memory_recall` pointer for
  multi-hop questions). Applies to both the plugin-served context
  (`MEMORY_LOOP_BLOCK`) and `examples/CLAUDE.memory.md` — guard-kept
  identical. Roughly 650 tokens per session, up from ~300.
- **`<data_dir>/hook-instructions.md` override**: when present and
  non-blank, `/api/hook/session-start` serves it instead of the shipped
  block (briefing still appended) — customize the standing instructions
  without forking the plugin; blank or unreadable falls back to the default.

### Added (2026-07-16 — Claude Code plugin + in-repo marketplace)
- **Claude Code plugin `pseudolife-memory`** (`plugin/`), installable from
  this repo as a marketplace (`/plugin marketplace add
  Pseudogiant-xr/Pseudolife-MCP` → `/plugin install
  pseudolife-memory@pseudolife-mcp`). It replaces the installer's three
  wiring steps: a bundled `.mcp.json` (HTTP server at `127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`)
  instead of `claude mcp add`, a SessionStart hook (bash + curl, no pip
  package on the host) instead of the settings.json briefing hook, and the
  memory-loop instructions served as session context instead of the
  CLAUDE.md append. Ships `/dream` and a new `/memory-status` command.
  Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-claude-code-plugin-design.md`.
- **New daemon endpoint `GET /api/hook/session-start`** (plain text, 200
  always): the memory-loop instruction block plus the session briefing.
  Loopback-gated like the rest of `/api`; with a token set, an
  unauthorized request gets the instructions only — never memory content.
  Response capped at 9,500 chars (Claude Code's 10k hook-stdout limit).
- **Installers skip wiring when the plugin is installed** (detected via
  `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`) so hook + CLAUDE.md + mcp-add
  don't double up.
- Guard tests (`tests/test_plugin_packaging.py`): memory-loop block ==
  `examples/CLAUDE.memory.md`, plugin `/dream` == `examples/commands/dream.md`,
  plugin.json version == pyproject version (the release version-cut now
  touches **five** files), manifest/hook wiring sanity.

### Changed (2026-07-16 — sonnet-only leads the extractor choice)
- **Installer menu reordered**: the interactive extractor prompt in
  `ops/install.sh` / `ops/install.ps1` now offers `1) sonnet-only`,
  `2) sonnet-fallback`, `3) sidecar` (was sidecar-first), framing
  sonnet-only as the lightest install — the ~9 GB sidecar image is never
  built or pulled. **The number→mode mapping changed**: pressing `1` now
  selects sonnet-only, not sidecar. Non-interactive `--extractor <mode>`
  flags are unaffected. The README Quickstart bullets and its
  non-interactive example were reordered to match.

### Security (2026-07-16 — Dependabot triage: all four alerts unreachable, no bump possible)
- Triaged the four Dependabot alerts on `ops/requirements.lock.txt` (the
  daemon-image lock; none affect `pyproject.toml` install floors). All four
  were dismissed as *vulnerable code not used*, with the reasoning recorded
  in the lockfile header:
  - **chromadb CVE-2026-45829** (critical, pre-auth code injection in the
    Chroma HTTP server API): no patched release exists — 1.5.9 is both the
    locked and the latest version. The daemon embeds
    `chromadb.PersistentClient` with fixed collection parameters and never
    runs the Chroma server, so the vulnerable endpoint is not exposed. Bump
    when a patched release lands.
  - **transformers CVE-2026-1839 / CVE-2026-4372 / CVE-2026-5241** (Trainer
    checkpoint load, malicious-config RCE, LightGlue `trust_remote_code`
    bypass): fixed only in 5.x, but the image's ONNX embedding backend
    (`optimum-onnx`, latest 0.1.0) caps `transformers<4.58`, and 4.57.6 is
    the last 4.x release — no backport exists. All three require loading
    attacker-controlled models or checkpoints; the image runs
    `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` with pinned weights baked at build time, so none of
    the paths are reachable. Bump to ≥5.5 once optimum-onnx supports
    transformers 5.x.

### Changed (2026-07-16 — README restructured into a front door + docs/guide)
- **README.md cut from ~1450 to ~540 lines**: it keeps the front-door
  material (badges, hook, Quickstart, tools table, install, wiring, basic
  usage patterns, capabilities, troubleshooting) and links out for depth;
  the deep material moved to six new user-facing pages under
  **`docs/guide/`** — `configuration.md`, `retrieval.md`, `dreaming.md`,
  `episodes.md`, `memory-model.md`, `benchmarks.md`. The README doubles as
  the PyPI description, so the shorter version ships at the next release.
  Guard tests moved with their content (`tests/test_release_ux.py`): the
  schema-version DSN-row pin now points at `docs/guide/configuration.md`,
  the no-test-count rule sweeps every guide page, and two new guards pin
  the MCP-registry `mcp-name` marker in the README and require every
  `docs/guide/` page to be linked from the README (nothing moved goes
  dark). `docs/README.md` now distinguishes the maintained `guide/` pages
  from internal design history.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-07-16 — Pseudolife (one word), release automation, CLI help

### Changed (2026-07-16 — the name is a word now)
- **"PseudoLife" → "Pseudolife" everywhere** (87 files): the name now reads
  as a coined closed compound — like *pseudocode*, *pseudonym* — rather than
  a CamelCase brand; machine identifiers (`pseudolife-mcp`, volumes,
  containers, env vars) were already lowercase and are unchanged. This
  includes the MCP server display name (`FastMCP("Pseudolife Memory")`), the
  Cortex Console title, and repo URLs (now matching the GitHub repo's actual
  casing; old-casing URLs redirect regardless).

### Added (2026-07-16 — PyPI Trusted Publishing workflow)
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** — publishing a GitHub release now
  builds + `twine check`s and uploads to PyPI via Trusted Publishing (OIDC;
  no stored API token), gated on a tag==pyproject version guard and the
  `pypi` environment's required-reviewer approval. One-time setup: add the
  Trusted Publisher on PyPI (owner/repo/workflow/environment) and create the
  `pypi` environment with a required reviewer, then retire the API token.

### Changed (2026-07-16 — WSL memory guidance matches the E4B sidecar)
- **`ops/wslconfig.example` sizing was still E2B-era** (stack "~2 GiB
  resident", 16 GB laptop → `memory=6GB`): the default E4B v2 bake mmaps a
  ~5.3 GB model, so the guidance now plans ~6–7 GiB for sidecar mode
  (16 GB → `8GB`, 32 GB → `10GB`) and notes sonnet-only installs need ~1 GiB.
  README's WSL note updated to match.

### Added (2026-07-16 — CLI help)
- **`pseudolife-mcp --help` / `-h` / `help`** prints a usage summary of all
  six modes and exits 0; unknown modes now point at `--help`. Previously the
  first thing a fresh `pip install` user typed answered "unknown mode".

### Fixed (2026-07-16 — toolset-tier follow-ups)
- **`memory_toolset` docstring** no longer claims hidden tools remain
  callable by exact name — Claude harnesses gate tool calls client-side
  against their own list, so clients must expand first. The tiers spec's
  failure-modes section records the confirming incident.
- **Every ops script requires PowerShell 7** (`#Requires -Version 7`,
  previously only the installers had it; now also update, backup, restore,
  preflight, prune-rollbacks, install-autostart) — Windows PowerShell 5.1
  turns benign native stderr (e.g. docker inspecting a not-yet-built image
  tag) into a terminating error mid-deploy; 5.1 now refuses upfront with a
  clear version error instead.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-16 — public-release cut

Everything since the 0.7.0 cut: the whole-bank galaxy console work, the
one-shot installer with extractor choice, Linux install parity, the published
E4B v2 extractor fine-tune as the shipped default, rollback-tag and backup
retention, the v2 release audit (state-volume backups, install hardening,
disk-growth caps), and the toolset-tier visibility rework.

### Fixed (2026-07-16 — 0.8.0.post1, metadata only)
- **PyPI `0.8.0.post1`** — identical code to 0.8.0; corrects the `mcp-name`
  ownership marker's namespace casing (`io.github.Pseudogiant-xr/…` — the MCP
  registry matches the GitHub username case-sensitively) and adds
  `server.json`, the registry manifest. Published to the official MCP
  registry as `io.github.Pseudogiant-xr/pseudolife-mcp`.

### Fixed (2026-07-16 — PyPI packaging)
- **The wheel now ships the Cortex Console** — `[tool.setuptools.package-data]`
  carries `pseudolife_memory/web/static/**` (css/fonts/js/index.html); without
  it a pip install served a 404 console (the Docker image was unaffected — it
  copies the whole package tree).
- `[project.urls]` (Homepage/Repository/Changelog/Issues) for the PyPI
  sidebar; the MCP registry ownership marker
  (`mcp-name: io.github.pseudogiant-xr/pseudolife-mcp`) embedded in the
  README, which is the package description; the README screenshot switched
  to an absolute URL so it renders off-repo.

### Fixed (2026-07-16 — tier changes now reach shim clients)
- **Shim forwards `tools/list_changed`** (landed inside the release-cut
  commit) — the shim's per-call upstream design meant the daemon's
  tier-change notification died on an ephemeral session and never reached
  the real client, which then rejected the newly visible tools client-side
  ("No such tool available" — Claude harnesses gate calls against their own
  list, so "hidden tools stay callable" never held in practice). The shim
  now advertises `tools.listChanged` in its downstream capabilities and
  re-emits the notification whenever a `memory_toolset` call reports
  `changed: true`. Found via the daily morning-brief scheduled task, which
  lost `memory_world_search`/`set` when the 2026-07-11 tier map demoted its
  writer (`claude-desktop`) to minimal.

### Fixed (2026-07-15 — Atlas polish)
- **"Assign a project" is a combobox** — the modal suggests every existing
  project (native datalist) while still accepting a brand-new name, so
  near-duplicate scopes ("Pseudolife" vs "pseudolife") stop being minted by
  accident.
- **"hide orphans" toolbar toggle** — hides degree-0 entities (the sparse
  halo unlocked by the whole-bank cap raise) in both galaxy and table views.
  Visibility-only: the layout never recomputes; the button shows the live
  orphan count.
- **Whole-bank galaxy** — the seedless graph cap defaults to 2000 nodes
  (was 300, a guard for the retired 2D canvas's O(n²) per-frame sim). The
  full ~1.2k-entity bank now renders, orphans included; the cap machinery
  and truncation banner remain as the safety valve for much larger banks.
- **No more self-moving camera** — selecting a star during the initial
  layout warmup froze the view target correctly, but the settle-time "drift
  correction" re-flew the camera (a visible zoom-out-zoom-in). Fly-to now
  freezes the simulation instead (the inspected star cannot drift), auto-fit
  runs only on a completely untouched view, and the layout pre-simulates 60
  warmup ticks so an early freeze still lands on a formed map.
- **Galaxy pulse is a decision signal again** — stars pulse only for
  item-level findings awaiting judgment (duplicates, merge/junk candidates,
  proposed links). Bulk hygiene lists (orphan / unattributed / dubious-edge —
  1,700+ names on the live bank) no longer light up the whole galaxy; they
  stay in the Review drawer.
- **Clicking a pulsing star now shows WHY it pulses**: the shell injects the
  cached review findings for that entity into its wiki-page banner (deduped
  against server-side flags), with the drawer's own confirm-gated actions —
  duplicate pairs get Merge / Mark distinct in place.

### Added (2026-07-15 — Atlas stage 3: time, review, focus)
- Galaxy time scrubber: replay the bank's growth — stars/edges appear by
  `created_at`/`asserted_at` over a fixed layout (visibility only, never
  re-simulated), with play/pause and a date readout; auto-play disabled under
  reduced motion.
- Contextual review: entities named in open findings pulse in the galaxy
  (static warn tint under reduced motion); wiki-page flag banners carry the
  same confirm-gated actions as the review drawer (merge / reject / accept /
  assign — identical descriptors, one action path); acting refreshes the
  galaxy and reopens the page.
- Isolate toggle on wiki pages: dims everything beyond the entity's 2-hop
  neighborhood client-side (no fetch) — the explore-mode replacement.

### Added (2026-07-15 — Atlas stage 2: the galaxy is the map)
- Console Graph tab rebuilt around the 3D galaxy: memory-state encodings
  (size = connections + facts, hue = project/community, brightness = recency),
  community nebulae with constellation labels, proximity-faded star labels
  (nearest 40), search with dim/highlight + Enter-to-fly, and wiki-page
  click-through — clicking a star or a wikilink flies the camera and opens the
  page. Review queue lives in a left drawer; table mode is the fallback
  (automatic, with a notice, when WebGL/the 3D bundle is unavailable).
- `/api/graph` whole-graph payload carries `created_at` per node and
  `asserted_at` per edge (additive; feeds the recency encoding now, the time
  scrubber in stage 3).
- Vendored `galaxy.bundle.js` (3d-force-graph 1.73.6 + three 0.185.1 from one
  dependency graph — single three instance; esbuild, legal comments embedded;
  license audit MIT×18/ISC×14/BSD-3×4, allowlist-gated, inventory + reproducible
  build recipe in `vendor/README.md`) replaces `3d-force-graph.bundle.js`.

### Removed (2026-07-15 — Atlas stage 2)
- The 2D canvas force-graph map and the Overview/Explore mode split. Legacy
  `mode=`/`depth=` deep links still resolve (extra params ignored); an
  `entity=` deep link overrides a sticky table view.

### Added (2026-07-15 — Atlas stage 1: entity wiki pages)
- **`GET /api/wiki?entity=X`** — one-call, live-rendered entity page for the
  console: identity + aliases + project attribution + first-seen, canonical
  facts (with lazy supersession history), cited world facts, relations in/out
  (derived edges marked with rule provenance), provenance mentions, a merged
  newest-first timeline, and open review flags (proposals + unattributed;
  never re-runs the full review scan). No LLM in the loop — pages are
  assembled from structured data at request time, so they cannot go stale.
- **Console: clicking a graph node opens the entity's wiki page** in a
  browsable panel (replaces the small node-panel); entity names inside the
  page are wikilinks that swap the page in place.
- Storage: `find_entity`/`load_graph` expose `entities.created_at`
  (additive; feeds first-seen and the upcoming galaxy time scrubber).

### Added (2026-07-14 — state-volume backup/restore, v2 release audit)
- **`ops/backup.ps1|.sh` now also tar the daemon state volume** into a
  sibling `pseudolife_state-<stamp>.tgz`: ingested `document_ingest` files
  (ChromaDB), the cortex snapshot, and graph snapshots live *only* there, so
  the pg_dump alone silently lost them on disaster recovery despite the
  compose header telling users a backup covers "state". Warn-never-throw (a
  stopped daemon skips the tar loudly but never aborts a deploy's backup
  step); rotation and the off-disk mirror cover both artifact kinds
  (`-MirrorKeep`/`--mirror-keep` caps each kind at newest N).
- **`ops/restore.ps1 -StateArchive <tgz>` / `restore.sh --state-archive`** —
  opt-in state-volume restore (a DB-only restore must not clobber current
  state): rehearsal integrity-lists the tar; `-Apply` replaces `/data` while
  the daemon is stopped, via the daemon's own image with `--volumes-from`
  (no volume-name resolution, no image pull). Without the flag, restore
  prints a hint when state archives exist.

### Fixed (2026-07-14 — v2 release audit)
- **Restore rehearsal no longer false-fails on a young bank** — the
  entries/facts sanity check now alarms only when the *live* bank has rows
  the restored copy lost; a fresh install with no dream-run facts (0 rows)
  produced a valid backup that the rehearsal declared untrustworthy.
- **`ops/install.sh` no longer aborts mid-install when shim autostart fails**
  (parity with the `.ps1`): on a host without `systemd --user` (macOS, some
  WSL), a Sonnet-mode install died between `compose up` and the
  hooks/`claude mcp add`/health steps — a running stack never wired into
  Claude Code. Step 7 is now best-effort with a re-run hint.
- **`ops/install.ps1` and `ops/install-hook.ps1` now enforce
  `#Requires -Version 7`** — under Windows PowerShell 5.1 their
  `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` writes a BOM that garbles the first `ops/.env`
  key and can break `settings.json` parsing; 5.1 users now fail fast with the
  pwsh install pointer instead of writing corrupted config.
- **`encode([])` returns an empty `(0, dim)` tensor again** — the 2026-07-12
  embedding-cache rework made `torch.stack` raise on an empty text list
  (latent; no current caller can pass one, guard restored for defensiveness).

### Changed (2026-07-14 — v2 release audit: disk hygiene + preflight)
- **All three compose services now cap container logs** (`json-file`,
  `max-size: 10m` × 3 files) — Docker's default json-file driver has no size
  limit, so months of daemon/pg/extractor stdout grew the disk unbounded.
  Applies on the next `up -d` (container recreate).
- **`.dockerignore` now excludes `evals/`, `tests/`, `examples/`, and
  `unsloth_compiled_cache/`** — no Dockerfile copies from them, and a
  populated `evals/models/` (tens of GB of local GGUFs) was being tarred
  into every `docker compose build` context and build-cache entry.
- **`ops/preflight.ps1|.sh` now check ports 8765/5433** (warn-only): a taken
  port previously surfaced as a cryptic compose "port is already allocated";
  ports held by an existing Pseudolife stack count as OK, so idempotent
  re-runs stay green.
### Added (2026-07-14 — superseded-row compaction)
- **Superseded-row compaction** — corrections no longer grow the canonical
  stores forever: on each dream sweep tick, `facts`/`world_facts`/`lessons`
  keep the newest 3 superseded/retired versions per slot and purge older
  ones after 30 days (config `memory.compaction.*`, console group
  "Retention"; the per-slot sync deletes the PG rows). `memory_history`
  timelines keep their recent versions; entries (bounded band eviction,
  supersession is retrieval-load-bearing) and edges (sticky-removal
  tombstones the dream's `revive=False` depends on) are deliberately
  untouched. The in-memory cortex supersession log is now capped at its
  persisted size (200). No schema change. Spec:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-14-superseded-row-compaction-design.md`.

### Changed (2026-07-14 — extractor default = published v2 fine-tune)
- **`ops/Dockerfile.extractor` now bakes the bespoke extractor fine-tune by
  default** (`MODEL_URL` →
  `Pseudogiant-xr/pseudolife-extractor-gemma-4-e4b/…/pseudolife-extractor-e4b-v2-Q4_K_M.gguf`
  on Hugging Face, ~5.3 GB) instead of the Gemma 4 E4B QAT base model. This is
  the Arm-1 registry-datagen student (same-session KU-oracle: cortex 0.705 vs
  0.603, hybrid 0.756 vs 0.744 against the prior fine-tune; ladder stale-leak
  0.0) — fresh installs now get the production extractor without a local GGUF
  mount. The lighter E2B QAT bake for constrained machines is unchanged
  (`--build-arg MODEL_URL=…`), as is the runtime GGUF mount override.

### Added (2026-07-14 — rollback-tag retention in the deploy scripts)
- **`ops/prune-rollbacks.ps1` / `ops/prune-rollbacks.sh`**, called by
  `update.ps1` / `update.sh` after tagging each new rollback image (and safe
  to run standalone): keeps the newest N `pre-*` rollback tags of the daemon
  image and `docker rmi`s the rest — one tag was minted per deploy and never
  garbage-collected, which had piled up ~60 stale tags inside a 177GB
  docker_data.vhdx by 2026-07-14. N defaults to 2 and is overridable via
  `update.ps1 -KeepRollbacks N` / `update.sh --keep-rollbacks N`. Never
  removes the deployed tag (it doesn't match the `pre-*` naming) or any image
  a running container uses (protects the just-minted rollback mid-deploy
  too), and never touches volumes; a retention failure warns but does not
  abort the deploy.
- **Count-based mirror retention in `ops/backup.ps1|.sh`** — `-MirrorKeep N`
  / `--mirror-keep N` / `PSEUDOLIFE_BACKUP_MIRROR_KEEP=N` caps the off-disk
  mirror at the newest N files by filename stamp (cloud-synced folders have
  untrustworthy mtimes and metered space; the age-based `KeepDays` window
  kept 10+ files there with no way to say "exactly N"). Unset/0 preserves
  the age-based behavior; the primary `data/backups` rotation is unchanged.

### Added (2026-07-14 — one-shot installer with extractor choice, #13 tier 2)
- **`ops/install.sh` / `ops/install.ps1`** — idempotent one-command install:
  preflight → volumes → **extractor choice** → compose up → session hooks →
  CLAUDE.md memory block (consent prompt; `--claude-md append|skip`) →
  `claude mcp add` → health check → per-mode verify hints. The extractor mode
  is always an explicit choice (`--extractor sidecar|sonnet-fallback|
  sonnet-only`; interactive prompt, no default); re-running with a different
  mode is the supported way to switch. Dream env lives in a managed marker
  block in `ops/.env`, so user lines outside it survive re-runs.
- **The extractor sidecar is now optional** (`sonnet-only` mode): the
  installer writes `profiles: ["disabled"]` for the sidecar into the
  gitignored compose override, so the ~9 GB image is never built or pulled;
  the mode sets `PSEUDOLIFE_DREAM_EXTRACTOR_MODE=primary` (states the intent,
  keeps the auto-without-fallback startup warning silent) and dreams pause
  with per-sweep retry while the shim is down. A pre-existing user override
  (e.g. a GGUF mount) is never merged into — the snippet is printed instead.
  Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-14-installer-extractor-choice-design.md`.

### Changed (2026-07-14 — one-shot installer with extractor choice, #13 tier 2)
- **The daemon no longer `depends_on` the extractor sidecar** — extraction is
  runtime HTTP with per-sweep retry, and a hard dependency on a
  profile-disabled service is a compose error. Worst case for stock installs:
  a dream sweep fires before the extractor finishes loading → that probe
  fails and retries next sweep.

### Fixed (2026-07-14 — hook installer + shim autostart, found by installer live-test)
- **`ops/install-hook.ps1|.sh` no longer install the obsolete episode-start/
  episode-end hooks** (obsolete since the 2026-06-30 session-scoped episodes
  rework — the daemon owns episode lifecycle, keyed by `mcp-session-id`) and
  now **remove** any found, so installs that got them earlier converge.
- **`ops/install-shim-autostart.ps1` no longer claims success when
  `Register-ScheduledTask` is denied** (CIM cmdlet errors don't reliably
  terminate under `$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"`): the cmdlet gets an
  explicit `-ErrorAction Stop` plus a Get-ScheduledTask existence check, so
  an unelevated run now throws and `install.ps1` prints the recovery steps.

### Added (2026-07-14 — Linux install parity + install UX, issues #11/#12/#13)
- **`ops/install-shim-autostart.sh`** — Linux parity for the Sonnet-shim
  autostart (`systemd --user` unit; the `.ps1` was Windows-only, so a Linux
  user following the README silently stayed on the sidecar). Binds the docker
  bridge IP, not loopback: `host-gateway` routes container→host traffic to
  the bridge, where a `127.0.0.1` bind is invisible. `sonnet_shim.py` grew a
  `--host` flag (default `127.0.0.1`) to support that.
- **`ops/preflight.sh` / `ops/preflight.ps1`** — check-only doctor scripts
  (issue #13 first slice): verify docker (installed / daemon reachable /
  socket permission), compose v2, git, python, and the `claude` CLI, printing
  the exact remediation line per failure. Never installs anything.
- **Startup warnings for silent extractor half-configurations**
  (`startup_extractor_warnings` in `dream.py`, logged by the daemon at dream
  sweep start): unresolvable `host.docker.internal` (missing `extra_hosts`),
  `extractor_mode=auto` with a host-side primary but no fallback (auto is
  inert), and primary == fallback (the intended primary is never used). The
  stock single-extractor default stays silent.

### Changed (2026-07-14 — Linux install parity + install UX, issues #11/#12/#13)
- **The CLAUDE.md memory-loop block is now a first-class install step** — the
  Quickstart appends `examples/CLAUDE.memory.md` to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  explicitly, the agent-setup section leads with the same one-liners, and
  `ops/install-hook.ps1|.sh` warn (check-and-advise only, never editing
  CLAUDE.md) when the settings-adjacent CLAUDE.md lacks the block. A fresh
  install on another machine (#12) ended with healthy hooks + daemon but a
  memory loop that never fired, because no standing instruction existed and
  the README only carried it in a deep section.
- **`extra_hosts: host.docker.internal:host-gateway` is now enabled by
  default** in `ops/docker-compose.yml` (was a commented snippet) — on Linux
  Docker Engine, any host-side extractor URL silently failed every probe and
  dreams stayed on the fallback forever; the entry is harmless on Docker
  Desktop.
- **`ops/update.ps1|.sh` scaffold `ops/.env`** from `ops/.env.example` when
  missing (all values commented — behavior unchanged, knobs discoverable).
- README: preflight + Linux docker-group prerequisite in the Quickstart, and
  the Sonnet-primary section gained the Linux autostart path, the
  "both vars flip together" warning, and a `memory_dream(action="status")`
  verify step.

### Changed (2026-07-12 — release hygiene: machine-local compose overrides)
- **Extractor GGUF swaps moved to `ops/docker-compose.override.yml`**
  (gitignored) — the tracked compose file no longer mounts a fine-tuned GGUF
  that only exists on the maintainer's machine (a fresh clone got an empty
  directory bind-mounted over `/models/extractor.gguf` and the sidecar
  crash-looped; the baked base model now serves by default).
  `ops/update.ps1|.sh` add the override automatically when the file exists
  (explicit `-f` disables compose's auto-merge); manual compose commands
  append `-f ops/docker-compose.override.yml`.
- **`ops/.env.example`** — a commented template for every env override the
  compose stack reads (volume names, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `TZ`, toolset tier
  map, dream extractor primary/fallback endpoints).
- Dev harnesses and docs no longer hardcode maintainer-machine paths or LAN
  endpoints: eval scripts derive from `$env:USERPROFILE`/`Path.home()`/
  `$PSScriptRoot`, `sonnet_shim.py` resolves the `claude` CLI from `PATH`
  (`PSEUDOLIFE_SHIM_CLAUDE_CLI` or `--cli` overrides), and the `qwen-a3b`
  bench rung reads `PSEUDOLIFE_BENCH_A3B_URL` (default localhost) like the
  existing `PSEUDOLIFE_BENCH_QWEN_URL`.

### Added (2026-07-12 — embedding backend + cache, reranker margin gate)
- **ONNX embedding backend** (`embedding.backend: onnx`, new `[onnx]` extra =
  `optimum[onnxruntime]`) — the same MiniLM through onnxruntime at ~3x the
  single-text encode speed on CPU (5.0ms → 1.6ms measured) with **bit-identical
  embeddings** (fp32 cosine vs torch = 1.00000; the qint8 variants were
  rejected for ~0.008 cosine drift). Fail-soft: any load failure falls back to
  torch with a warning. Under `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` (the daemon's runtime
  contract) the pipeline resolves the model to its local HF snapshot first —
  optimum otherwise calls the hub tree API even when fully cached. The MCP
  defaults overlay flips `backend` to `onnx` whenever optimum is importable
  (the daemon image now bakes it + the ONNX weights); plain pip installs stay
  on torch. `embedding.backend` in config.yaml overrides either way.
  Lock note: `optimum-onnx` (all releases) caps `transformers<4.58`, so the
  image pins step back to `transformers==4.57.6` + `huggingface_hub==0.36.2`
  — the exact stack the full suite (1022 tests) validated locally. Revisit
  when optimum-onnx supports transformers 5.x.
- **Embedding LRU cache** (`embedding.cache_size`, default 1024, 0 disables) —
  keyed on `(text, normalize)`; repeat encodes of the same string (query text
  re-embedded across search + slot ops, dedup keys, warmup probes) skip the
  model forward entirely. Returned tensors are always fresh copies, so caller
  mutation can't poison the cache. Hit/miss counters on the pipeline.
- **Reranker margin gate** (`reranker.skip_margin`, default 0.0 = off) — when
  set, the cross-encoder pass (~200ms) is skipped iff the gap between the two
  best bi-encoder-adjusted scores is >= the margin (measured on *sorted* head
  scores — the head is neural + reference concatenated, not globally sorted);
  a one-candidate head is trivially unambiguous. Skips are visible in the
  retrieval trace as `reranker.reason = "unambiguous_margin"`. Opt-in: no
  deployment default until a threshold is tuned against real traffic.

### Changed (2026-07-12 — retrieval + graph lookup performance)
- **Slot-query pool (Pool 1.5) inverted index** — `memory_search` no longer
  scans every band entry per `query_text` query; slot tokens live in a
  token → (ordinal, band, entry) index. Stores extend it in place (slotless
  stores — the common case — leave it untouched), so interleaved store/search
  traffic never pays a full rebuild; removals (evict / delete / promote /
  clear) and wholesale replacement (`load` / `hydrate_cms`) flag a lazy
  rebuild. Band filtering keys on the containing band (matching the old
  full-scan semantics even for stale `bank` stamps after a preset change),
  and equal-score ties keep deterministic band-then-insertion order across
  processes.
- **`edges(dst_id)` index (schema v21 → v22)** — dst-side edge lookups
  (`merge_entity`'s dedup/repoint, reverse traversals) stop sequential
  scanning; the `UNIQUE(src_id, relation, dst_id)` constraint index only
  serves src-leading queries.

### Added (2026-07-11 — Sonnet extractor sidecar cutover)
- Dream extractor primary/fallback selection: `PSEUDOLIFE_DREAM_FALLBACK_BASE_URL`
  / `_FALLBACK_MODEL` / `_EXTRACTOR_MODE` (auto|primary|fallback), automatic
  fallback when the primary probe fails, extractor badge + override in the
  Console, `dream_status` extractor fields, shim `/health` CLI check,
  `ops/install-shim-autostart.ps1`. Inert until the fallback URL is set.

### Added (2026-07-11 — session-scoped toolset tiers)
- **Three visibility tiers** (`minimal` ⊂ `core` ⊂ `full`) filtered per
  session at `tools/list`; all tools always register and hidden tools stay
  callable (core mode previously *unregistered* them — calls now succeed).
- **`memory_toolset(action)`** — expand/collapse THIS session's tier one
  rung at a time (floor = the session's default), `status` for the ladder;
  emits `tools/list_changed` (capability now advertised).
- **`PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_TIER_MAP`** — per-writer default tiers
  (`claude-desktop:minimal,claude-code:core`); `PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_TOOLSET`
  becomes the default tier rather than a registration gate.
- **Docstring trim + manifest budgets** — per-tier char caps pinned by
  tests (minimal ≤4.5k, core ≤9.5k, full ≤15.5k; per-tool 1.6k).

### Added (2026-07-11 — entity hygiene guards)
- Entity hygiene guards (2026-07-11 curation follow-up): slot-key names fold
  to their fact's owner entity; new junk classes `metric-reading`,
  `list-artifact` (write gate + detection) and `compound-artifact`
  (detection-only); variant-token (size/quant/version) conflicts hard-block
  merge proposals in write-dedup, the dream-alias post-pass, and deep-dream
  partition; cross-project dream proposals now require a typed relation;
  REST entity-verdict routes accept `decided_by`.

### Changed (2026-07-10 — toolset tier overridable per deployment)
- **`PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_TOOLSET` in `ops/docker-compose.yml` now reads from the
  environment** (`${PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_TOOLSET:-core}`): the shipped default stays
  `core`, but a deployment can set `PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_TOOLSET=full` in `ops/.env`
  without editing the compose file. Useful for clients that defer MCP tool
  schemas client-side (e.g. Claude Code), where the full surface costs only
  the extra tool names until a schema is actually requested.

### Changed (2026-07-10 — compact-by-default recall payloads)
- **The five recall-path tools return compact entries by default** —
  `memory_search`, `memory_recall`, `memory_recent`, `memory_world_search`,
  and `memory_lesson_search` now ship only the fields an agent acts on
  (associative entries: `{id, text, source, tags, score}` plus `superseded` /
  `superseded_by_text` when set; recall facts: `{attribute, value}`, edges:
  `{src, relation, dst}`; world/lesson entries similarly trimmed to their
  documented cores, keeping `effective_confidence`/`stale`/citation and
  `re_verify`). Trims ~40% of a typical associative entry (measured on a
  representative long-text entry; short entries save proportionally more).
  New `verbose=true` flag on all five restores the full
  metadata (timestamps, counters, band/episode attribution, provenance);
  `explain=true` on `memory_search` implies `verbose`. Result payloads are
  the second half of the 2026-07-10 token-cost lever (the toolset gate below
  was the first). Cortex Console REST responses are unaffected — the
  compaction lives at the MCP transport layer only.

### Changed (2026-07-10 — core toolset promoted to the deployed default)
- **`memory_episode_start` / `memory_episode_end` are core-tier now** — the
  recommended CLAUDE.md workflow opens named sub-episodes for multi-step
  tasks, so core mode (19 tools) keeps every tool name that workflow
  references.
- **`ops/docker-compose.yml` ships with `PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_TOOLSET: core`
  enabled** (was a commented-out opt-in). The full manifest is agent context
  re-read every turn (~15k chars of descriptions across 32 tools); core trims
  ~40% of that with no workflow loss — the trimmed tail (dream, graph review,
  forget/supersede, episode summaries, consolidation) runs on daemon cadence
  or via the Cortex Console. Set `full` (or comment the line out) for admin
  sessions.

### Added (2026-07-10 — known-facts window for dream pass)
- Known-facts window for the dream pass (`memory.dream.known_facts_window`,
  default 0 = off): the extractor prompt shows current values of the top-N
  relevance-ranked slots so updates supersede in place instead of minting
  paraphrase keys. `--window` flags on `evals/longmemeval_bench.py` and
  `evals/ladder_sweep.py`; echo guard in `evals/window_echo_check.py`.
  (docs/specs/2026-07-10-known-facts-window-design.md)

### Added (2026-07-07 — Console: Extractor panel + dedup knobs)
- **Console Extractor panel** — the dream extractor endpoint is now
  switchable from the Cortex Console: base URL (with suggestions for the
  bundled sidecar, LM Studio, and Ollama), model name, call timeout, and max
  output tokens. A new `extractor_source` switch decides who owns these
  settings: `env` (default — the documented `PSEUDOLIFE_DREAM_*` ops
  contract, unchanged) or `config` (the panel's values win and the env vars
  are ignored; otherwise a UI change would silently lose to the env defaults
  the compose file always sets). All live — `build_extractor` constructs the
  client fresh on every dream invocation. The API key stays env-only in both
  modes (secrets never land in config.yaml); string knobs validate http(s)
  URLs at the write boundary.
- **New Console knobs** — `write_dedup_min_jaccard`,
  `alias_candidate_min_cosine` (Dream group) and
  `dream_slot_match_threshold` (Cortex group) are now editable live.

### Added (2026-07-07 — dream alias-candidate post-pass)
- **`MemoryService._propose_dream_alias_candidates`** — after a dream cycle
  writes its claims, every freshly-minted cortex entity name is cosine-
  compared (name embeddings) against existing entity names; the best match
  at/above `alias_candidate_min_cosine` (new `DreamConfig` knob, default 0.5,
  0 disables) files a merge proposal into the existing `entity_proposals`
  review queue — dismissed-pair suppression, unique-index dedupe, Atlas
  merge queue, and the accept/dismiss flows are all reused, and nothing is
  ever auto-folded. Semantic complement to the token-Jaccard write-dedup:
  paraphrase coreference ("production extractor sidecar" ~ "Pseudolife-MCP
  default extractor sidecar", Jaccard 0.33) embeds at cosine 0.65 while
  unrelated pairs calibrate ≤ 0.17 on all-MiniLM-L6-v2. Dream summaries gain
  an `alias_candidates` count.
- **`CortexStore.vocab_ranked` + `MemoryService._dream_vocab`**: the slot-key
  hint handed to the dream extractor is now ranked by cosine of each current
  slot's value-free embedding against the batch text, instead of taking the
  alphabetical head of the bank. On a bank larger than the ~60-key prompt
  window the alphabetical list rarely contained the keys a batch actually
  updates, so extractors minted paraphrase-variant entities instead of
  superseding (observed live 2026-07-06: a sidecar-version update never saw
  the existing `…sidecar.version` slot). Hint format is unchanged (the
  fine-tuned extractor was trained on it); alphabetical fallback on any
  ranking failure. KU-oracle re-run (e4b-ft, tag `vocabrank`): cortex 0.615
  vs 0.564, hybrid/rag within judge noise, ladder stale_leak 0.0 — the bench's
  per-question banks fit the window, so this mainly protects large live banks.
- **`evals/distill_clean.py`** — cleaning pass over the 2,000-row Qwen3.6-27B
  teacher-labeled extraction set (echo-key / spam-value / mega-row filters;
  1,756 rows / 7,823 claims kept).
- **`evals/distill_train_e4b.py`** — QLoRA SFT of Gemma-4 E4B on the cleaned
  set (WSL/4090, unsloth; pre-tokenized fixed 5120 shape so the graph compiles
  once, completion-only loss via manual −100 labels, eval batch 1, step-100
  checkpoints). `evals/distill_merge_e4b.py` re-merges from a checkpoint when
  the in-process merge is OOM-killed.
- **`evals/gate_e4b_ft.ps1`** + `e4b-ft` rung/extractor entries — acceptance
  gate for the fine-tune. Result: KU-oracle **cortex 0.564 / hybrid 0.769**
  vs base E4B QAT 0.359/0.551 — the 8B student beats its 27B teacher
  (0.397/0.590) on the task it was distilled for. Ladder: gold_recoverable
  1.0, stale_leak 0.0; CPU ~160s/question (same band as base E4B).
- **Deployed**: `ops/docker-compose.yml` mounts
  `evals/models/e4b-extractor-Q4_K_M.gguf` over the baked base model
  (drop the `volumes:` block to fall back). Verified live via a daemon dream
  cycle through the sidecar.

### Changed (2026-07-06 — default extractor sidecar E2B → E4B QAT)
- **`ops/Dockerfile.extractor` now bakes Gemma-4-E4B QAT (UD-Q4_K_XL, ~4.2GB)**
  instead of E2B QAT. The LongMemEval knowledge-update bench showed E4B builds
  a far stronger fact spine (cortex 0.333-0.359 vs E2B's 0.192; hybrid
  0.551-0.564 vs 0.474) at only ~1.4x E2B's CPU wall time per dream cycle.
  Qwen3.5-4B (higher still on GPU) was disqualified as a CPU sidecar: its
  verbose extractions deterministically overrun the generation cap on large
  batches (5.7x wall time with multi-minute retry tails). Constrained machines
  can bake E2B back via the documented `MODEL_URL` build-arg.
- **`--parallel 1` pinned in the extractor CMD**: newer llama.cpp server images
  default to 4 slots sharing one unified KV buffer, so two concurrent ~4k-token
  dream calls exceed the context and every request fails with "Context size has
  been exceeded". One slot restores the serialized behaviour older images had.
- **`PSEUDOLIFE_DREAM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` default 240 → 480** — E4B generates at
  roughly half E2B's CPU token rate, so a full 2048-token extraction needs the
  extra headroom.

### Changed (2026-07-06 — cortex retrieval floor lowered)
- **`memory.cortex.guard_min_score` default 0.3 → 0.2.** A LongMemEval
  retrieval replay (`evals/retrieval_sweep.py` over dumped fact banks) showed
  the 0.3 floor served *zero* cortex facts for 60% of questions: fact
  embeddings are terse `entity attribute value` strings whose cosine against
  a natural-language query rarely clears 0.3 even when the fact is the
  answer. 0.2 halves starvation (60% → 28%) at identical end-to-end accuracy
  in the before/after judge run (`evals/rebuild_contexts.py`). 0.1 was tried
  and rejected: it un-starves further but the extra weak facts dilute the
  context and the answerer abstains on questions it previously got right.
  Abstention-on deployments should keep overriding upward (`0.65` pairing,
  see README). The bench's cortex arm moved to `top_k=24, min_score=0.2`.
- **Phantom entry ids from a connection lost mid-store**: psycopg's
  transaction block exits *silently without committing* when the connection
  broke during the block (`pgconn.status != OK`), so `insert_entry` could
  return a RETURNING id for a row the server rolled back. `_txn` now verifies
  the transaction actually committed and raises `OperationalError` otherwise,
  so every mutator reports the loss instead of pretending success.
- **Permanent dream stall on `memory_traces_entry_id_fkey`**: when in-memory
  entries held db_ids absent from the entries table (the rolled-back-insert
  case above), every `dream_run` trace write hit the FK violation and the
  claim-write hold retried the SAME write each sweep — a stall only a process
  restart cleared (seen 2026-07-04 in evals bench runs). On a claim-write
  failure the dream now verifies the pulled batch's in-memory→PG entry
  mapping and re-flushes entries whose rows are gone (fresh row + id), so the
  hold resolves on the next sweep. New: `PostgresStorage.existing_entry_ids`,
  `CMS.reflush_entries`, regression tests in
  `tests/test_connection_loss_recovery.py`.

### Added (2026-07-04 — final polish batch)
- **Keyboard operability for click-only rows**: cortex fact rows, episode
  timeline items, Insight god-node rows and community rows, and Atlas
  provenance chips are now focusable and Enter/Space-activatable (new
  `pressable()` helper in `util.js`), each with an `aria-label`. The Insight
  god-node row is no longer a `<button>` wrapping another interactive element
  (invalid HTML) — the atlas jump is a real button inline with the name.
- **Confirm gate on "Dismiss" for duplicate findings** — marking a pair as
  genuinely distinct permanently stops it resurfacing, so it now confirms
  like the other irreversible actions (ordinary proposal rejects stay
  one-click for fast triage).
- **Graph → Cortex deep link**: the node panel's "Facts ↗" opens the Cortex
  view pre-filtered to that entity (`#/cortex?q=…`) instead of unfiltered.
- **`examples/CLAUDE.memory.md`** — the recommended CLAUDE.md memory block as
  a copyable file; **`docs/README.md`** — marks docs/ as internal design
  history and maps its subdirectories.
- **Manifest doc gaps**: `memory_search` enumerates the eight band names;
  `memory_forget` contrasts its OR-combined filters against search's AND.
### Added (2026-07-04 — UX fast-follow, P2 batch)
- **Recall tab explains itself**: a first-visit intro describes multi-hop vs
  path-between-two with runnable example queries; seed chips cap at 15 behind
  a "+N more" expander (with a one-line "what is a seed" hint); entities
  without canonical facts collapse into one compact chip block instead of a
  panel each.
- **`ops/install-hook.sh`** — Linux/macOS port of the briefing/episode hook
  installer (python3-based JSON edit, backup-first, idempotent, preserves
  existing hooks). Both installers stop writing the unrecognized
  `"shell": "bash"` field.
- **README Troubleshooting + Uninstall sections** — the scattered fixes
  (WSL `Vmmem` cap, port-forward loss after `wsl --shutdown`, first-build
  expectations, 401/offline meanings, `claude mcp list` check) collected
  under one heading; uninstall documents the deliberate volume-removal path.
- **Core tier grows by two**: `memory_get` (core `memory_fact_get` returns
  `source_entries` ids that core mode couldn't dereference) and
  `memory_session_title` (the recommended workflow names the session early).

### Fixed (2026-07-04 — UX fast-follow, P2 batch)
- **`memory_search` always returns the `cortex` key** (empty list on a miss —
  previously the documented key was absent, so `result["cortex"]` could
  KeyError).
- **Console a11y + interaction**: modals are `role="dialog"` with a focus
  trap and focus-restore-to-opener; toasts announce via `role="status"`;
  `confirmDialog` resolves `false` on backdrop/ESC close (previously the
  awaiting caller hung forever); keyboard shortcuts ignore Ctrl/Cmd/Alt
  chords and `0` reaches the tenth tab; the config editor treats an emptied
  number field as "no edit" instead of sending `""` (raw `float('')` error);
  the Observatory band-count subtitle reads from the live preset instead of
  a hardcoded "8".

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-04

(Header restored 2026-07-16: the original 0.7.0 cut (3ab06fc) placed it here;
a same-day edit (60bdf61) accidentally replaced the header line with its own
subsection, silently dissolving the release boundary for twelve days.)

### Fixed (2026-07-04 — pre-release UI/UX pass)
- **`memory_outcome` no longer coerces an unknown outcome to `"success"`**
  (which could invert a typo'd failure signal into a do-this lesson). An
  invalid value is refused up front — `{recorded: false, reason:
  "unknown_outcome", outcomes: [...]}` — and the tool schema now rejects it
  client-side too.
- **Console: one 401 notice instead of a storm.** With a token-gated daemon,
  the parallel boot fetches produced a stacked "Unauthorized" toast + token
  modal rebuild per call; the notifier is now latched until the token changes
  or a call succeeds. The token input is a `password` field.
- **Console: honest topbar.** An unreachable daemon shows an `offline` chip
  instead of the green pulsing `live`.
- **Console: no silent truncation.** `/api/facts`, `/api/world`, and
  `/api/lessons` return `total` + `truncated` alongside the capped `entries`,
  and the Cortex/World/Lessons views render "first N of M loaded" when the
  bank exceeds the fetch limit (the live bank's 1,358 facts were silently
  capped at 1,000 with no indication).
- **Console: Atlas review panel now follows both themes** — it referenced
  undefined `--surface-*` design tokens, so its chips/borders always fell
  back to hard-coded greys.

### Changed (2026-07-04 — MCP tool-surface ergonomics)
- **Verb-dispatch and enum params are typed `Literal`** so the JSON schema
  itself enumerates the legal values (`memory_dream.action`,
  `memory_forget.scope`, `memory_graph_review.action`,
  `memory_outcome.outcome`, `memory_world_set.freshness_class`,
  `memory_store.origin`, `memory_fact_set.origin`) — dispatch is discoverable
  from the manifest alone; the in-body structured-error fallbacks remain for
  direct callers.
- **Uniform failure contract**: a tool body that raises now returns the same
  `{"error", "message"}` shape the dispatch tools use, instead of leaking a
  raw exception string (e.g. `document_ingest` on a missing file).
- **`document_ingest` documents server-side path resolution** — with the
  Docker daemon the path must be visible inside the container.

### Added (2026-07-04 — docs & release hygiene)
- **README Quickstart** (clone → volumes → compose up → `claude mcp add` →
  verify) with the wiring step that was missing entirely: where the
  `mcpServers` JSON lives (`~/.claude.json` / project `.mcp.json`) and the
  `claude mcp add --transport http` one-liner.
- **Mechanical doc-drift guards** (`tests/test_release_ux.py`): README schema
  version must match `SCHEMA_META_VERSION` (it had drifted three separate
  times), no hardcoded test-count claims, and the Claude-Code wiring
  instructions must exist. Schema/capabilities rows corrected to v21; the
  stale 60-line Testing narrative replaced with a count-free summary; the
  broken `%USERPROFILE%` shim example fixed to `${USERPROFILE}`.

### Added (2026-07-04 — LongMemEval knowledge-update results)
- **First external-benchmark results** (`evals/results/longmemeval-ku-*`):
  LongMemEval knowledge-update subset (78 questions), floor (Gemma-4-E2B) +
  ceiling (Qwen3.6-27B) extractors, answerer/judge pinned to local Qwen3.6-27B.
  Oracle: hybrid 0.705 vs naive-RAG 0.615 at ~40% less context; cortex alone
  0.564 at 59 ctx tok/q (3.6% of RAG's budget). Full `_s` haystacks
  (~48 sessions/q): hybrid 0.372 vs RAG 0.321. The RAG control stays flat
  across extractors while cortex drops 0.564 → 0.192, isolating extraction
  quality as the fact-spine bottleneck. Overnight runner hardening: full
  `.bat` path (`NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath`), `Write-Host` logging
  (return-value pollution), and the bench now aborts only on a dead extractor
  endpoint (probe-gated, 8-hold cap) instead of on any transient extraction
  failure.

### Added (2026-07-03 — bigger-local-model extractor docs + compose overrides)
- **`PSEUDOLIFE_DREAM_*` are now overridable via `ops/.env`** (compose
  interpolation with the sidecar as the default), so the Dockerized daemon can
  point dream consolidation at LM Studio / Ollama / llama.cpp / vLLM without
  editing the compose file; commented `extra_hosts` snippet for Linux
  `host.docker.internal`. README gains an "Upgrading the extractor" section
  with per-runtime base URLs and the ladder-measured upgrade guidance.

### Fixed (2026-07-03 — dream extraction supersession regression)
- **Dream extraction is batched again**: the 2026-06-25 per-entry restructure
  (added for per-claim source traces) meant the extractor never saw a fact's
  initial and update turns together, so it named them inconsistently and
  updates landed on sibling slots instead of superseding — ladder stale-leak
  went 0.0 → 0.7–0.9 (all quants equally; the 06-24 QAT model swap was
  unrelated). `dream_run` now sends the whole pull in ONE numbered-notes call
  and the model cites each claim's source note (`"source"`), keeping trace
  attribution. Poison-entry quarantine survives via a per-entry isolation
  fallback after repeated batch failures, with an all-fail outage guard that
  holds the cursor instead of quarantining.

### Added (2026-07-03 — community files)
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** (dev setup, offline test invocation, live-bank safety
  rules, DCO sign-off, permissive-only dependency policy) and **SECURITY.md**
  (private vulnerability reporting, threat model, in/out of scope).

### Added (2026-07-03 — cross-platform ops)
- **Bash ops scripts**: `ops/backup.sh`, `ops/restore.sh`, `ops/update.sh` —
  feature-parity ports of the PowerShell originals for Linux/macOS hosts
  (same rehearse-by-default restore, rollback-tagged daemon-only update, and
  off-disk backup mirror). `.gitattributes` pins `*.sh` to LF.

### Changed (2026-07-03 — cross-platform ops)
- **Postgres password is overridable**: set `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `ops/.env`
  before first launch (compose default remains `pseudolife`, guarded by the
  loopback-only port binding; the daemon's `DATABASE_URL` follows the same
  variable).
- **Daemon image tag aligned to the package version** (`pseudolife-daemon:0.6.0`,
  was `0.2.0`), and both update scripts now read the tag from the compose file
  instead of hardcoding it — one source of truth for future bumps. Existing
  installs: the next `update.ps1`/`update.sh` run simply builds the new tag;
  old `0.2.0`-tagged images can be `docker image rm`'d at leisure.

### Changed (2026-07-03 — public-release licensing prep)
- **License: MIT → Apache-2.0** (LICENSE replaced with the canonical text,
  NOTICE added, pyproject + README updated). Apache-2.0 keeps the same
  permissive terms and adds an explicit patent grant.
- **Optional PDF extra: PyMuPDF → pypdfium2** (`pip install .[pdf]`).
  PyMuPDF is AGPL-3.0, which conflicts with permissive distribution and any
  future commercial/hosted offering; pypdfium2 (Chromium PDFium bindings,
  Apache-2.0/BSD-3) fills the same higher-quality-extraction slot. The core
  pypdf fallback is unchanged.

### Added (2026-07-03 — dream near-duplicate correction, schema v21)
- **Write-time dedup (Tier 1)**: a dream-minted entity whose name-token
  Jaccard against an existing canonical/display/alias reaches
  `memory.dream.write_dedup_min_jaccard` (default 0.6; 0 disables) files an
  `entity_proposals` merge row at birth — dismissed pairs suppressed, advisory
  only, never blocks the write. Explicit relate/fact writes untouched.
- **Deep-dream merge triage (Tier 2)**: `memory_dream(action="deep")`
  responses carry `merge_proposals` — pending near-duplicate merges enriched
  per side with display/etype/degree/scopes/snippets (`into` = higher-degree
  side); the `/dream deep` driver instructs the capable model to
  `accept_merge` same-referent variants, reject + `dismiss_pair` distinct
  ones, and leave unsure items for Atlas.
- **Merge-decision audit**: new FK-free `merge_decisions` table (an accepted
  merge CASCADE-deletes its proposal row, so the audit is denormalized) +
  `decided_by`/`decided_at` stamps on entity proposals; MCP decisions stamp
  `agent`, Console `human`; `/api/graph/review` and Atlas show
  "recent merge decisions" newest-first.

### Added (2026-07-03 — external findings wave 2)
- **Lesson staleness ("re-verify")**: lessons whose `about` entity saw cortex
  fact churn after the lesson was asserted/confirmed carry `re_verify` +
  `re_verify_reason` in `memory_lesson_search` / `/api/lessons`, and the
  session briefing renders a `⚠ re-verify` suffix. Read-time only — no stored
  state; re-confirming the lesson clears the flag.
- **Causal chain ("what led to X")**: `memory_history(entity)` without an
  `attribute` now returns the entity's dated event chain — canonical fact
  assertions/supersessions, source entries (with episode titles), graph
  edges, and lessons, merged oldest→newest. Also `GET /api/chain` and a
  timeline block in the Console's entity-provenance drawer.

### Added (2026-07-03 — external findings wave 1)
- **Betweenness god-nodes**: `god_nodes()` now ranks by betweenness centrality
  (bridges whose loss disconnects communities) with degree as tiebreak; each
  item carries a new `betweenness` field alongside `degree`. K-sampled above
  `memory.graph_insight.betweenness_sample` nodes.
- **`memory_fact_get` candidates on miss**: an empty slot (no record, no
  contenders) now returns `candidates` — same-entity slots first
  (recency-ranked), then embedding-similar slots above a 0.35 floor — ranked
  leads instead of a bare null.
- **Edge provenance tags**: graph edges surface a derived
  `EXTRACTED | INFERRED | AMBIGUOUS` tag (origin user/action; agent at working
  confidence; proposals + sub-0.5 confidence) in `memory_graph`, `/api/graph`,
  review findings, and as Atlas/Console badges. No schema change.

### Added (2026-07-03 — deep-dream review follow-ups)
- **Pre-apply graph snapshot**: `memory_dream(action="deep", apply=true)` first
  dumps the five graph tables to
  `data_dir/graph_snapshots/graph-<stamp>.json` (newest
  `memory.deep_dream.snapshot_keep` kept, default 10) and refuses with
  `snapshot_failed` — writing nothing — if the dump fails. Response carries the
  `snapshot` filename.
- **`memory_graph_review(action="dismiss_pair", src, dst)`**: record a
  "genuinely distinct" verdict over MCP (wires `graph_dismiss_duplicate`), so
  the Step-C agent can stop noise pairs resurfacing as deep-dream candidates.
- **Step-C driver flow**: `/dream deep` in `examples/commands/dream.md` +
  updated `docs/runbooks/deep-dream.md` — judge candidates from snippets, then
  propose / dismiss_pair / leave for Atlas.

### Changed (2026-07-03 — deep-dream review follow-ups)
- **Candidate snippets truncated** to `memory.deep_dream.snippet_max_chars`
  (default 240) — the full-length deep response had outgrown MCP output limits
  (~483KB) — and `memory_dream(..., snippets=false)` omits them entirely.
- **Support-overlap filter**: `candidate_pairs` drops pairs whose
  supporting-entry sets overlap at Jaccard >=
  `memory.deep_dream.max_support_overlap` (default 0.8), generalizing the old
  identical-set (co-occurrence) drop and killing the same-doc verb-cluster
  noise.
- **Dry-run/apply parity**: `would_merge_propose` / `would_junk` items are
  annotated `already_proposed` when an entity_proposals row (any status)
  already covers them — the preview now predicts the apply counters.

### Added (2026-07-02 — episode naming + fragmentation rework)
- **Episode consolidation primitives**: `service.episode_rename(id, title)`
  and `service.episode_merge(sources, into?/title?, hint?)` re-stamp the
  denormalised `episode_id`/`episode_title` on band entries (in-memory + DB),
  bulk-retarget evicted entries and `outcome_signals`
  (`PostgresStorage.retarget_episode_refs`), re-parent child episodes, widen
  the target span, and delete the merged husks. REST:
  `POST /api/episodes/rename`, `POST /api/episodes/merge`. Open sources are
  skipped (`skipped_open`) — a live session is never merged away.
- **Resume-on-return**: a store arriving after the idle reaper closed the
  session's episode now *reopens* that episode (same `mcp-session-id` = same
  client session) instead of opening a fresh generic husk.
  `PSEUDOLIFE_SESSION_RESUME_SECONDS` (default 21600 = 6 h) bounds the window;
  `0` disables.
- **Auto-title at close**: a session episode still carrying the generic
  `session - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` lazy-open title gets a derived
  `"{dominant_source} - {stamp}: {first-entry snippet}"` title when it closes
  (explicit end or reaper). Agent-set titles never match the generic pattern
  and are untouched (`session_title.derive_session_title`).
- **Untitled-session nudge**: `memory_store` responses include a one-line
  `episode_hint` while the session episode is still generic-titled, pointing
  at `memory_session_title`.

### Fixed (2026-07-02 — episode naming + fragmentation rework)
- `memory_episode_start` called before the session's first store now lazily
  opens the session root first and nests under it, instead of creating a
  session-keyed root that `memory_session_title` would then rename.
- `memory_session_title` now also rewrites the denormalised `episode_title`
  stamp on entries already stored in the session.

### Changed (2026-07-02 review, final item — MCP tool-surface consolidation)
- **BREAKING: the MCP surface shrank from 55 tools to 32** (the manifest is
  agent context every session: description payload dropped ~37.0k → ~15.0k
  chars, ~60%). Three verb-dispatched tools replace fifteen:
  - `memory_dream(action=...)` — `status` / `pull` / `commit` / `run` /
    `deep` (replaces `memory_dream_status/pull/commit/run` +
    `memory_deep_dream`).
  - `memory_forget(scope=...)` — `memory` / `fact` / `world` / `lesson`
    (replaces `memory_delete`, `memory_fact_forget`, `memory_world_forget`,
    `memory_lesson_forget`). Scope `memory` now returns a structured
    `{error: "filter_required"}` on a filterless call instead of a raw
    ToolError.
  - `memory_graph_review(action=...)` — `list` / `propose` / `accept_link` /
    `reject_link` / `accept_merge` / `accept_junk` / `reject_entity`
    (replaces `memory_graph_propose_links` + the five accept/reject tools;
    `list` newly exposes `service.graph_review` over MCP).
- **Removed from MCP** (Console REST + CLI cover them; service methods and
  `/api` routes unchanged): `memory_facts`, `memory_world_facts`,
  `memory_lessons`, `memory_list_sources`, `memory_list_tags`,
  `memory_episode_list`, `memory_communities`, `memory_digest`,
  `memory_briefing` (the SessionStart hook uses `pseudolife-mcp briefing`),
  `memory_path` (use `memory_graph(to=...)`), `memory_save` (autosave loop +
  exit flush already cover durability).
- **Every remaining docstring rewritten terse** — first line says what the
  tool does, when-to-use guidance kept only where it changes behaviour.
  `tests/test_tool_consolidation.py` pins the budget (≤1600 chars/tool,
  ≤18k total) plus dispatch/validation contracts for the three merged tools.
- Core-tier membership (`PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_TOOLSET=core`) is unchanged — all 15
  core tools kept their names, as did every tool referenced by the global
  CLAUDE.md workflow. `/dream` command and deep-dream runbook updated to the
  new verbs.

### Fixed/Changed (2026-07-02 review P3 — surface polish + zombie sweep)
- **Tokenless `/api` is now browser-hardened** (review H2, live exposure —
  the daemon runs without a token): foreign `Origin` → 403 (CSRF, covers
  bodyless POSTs), foreign `Host` → 403 (DNS rebinding), and any POST with
  a body must be `application/json` → 415 (a cross-site form can't send
  that without a failing CORS preflight). Non-browser clients send neither
  header and pass; with a token set the host gates are skipped (the
  Authorization header already proves intent, so LAN use stays legitimate).
- **Console Stream view repaired**: search/recent entries now carry the
  storage row `id` (the engram-trace button finally renders live, and
  agents can pair hits with `memory_get`/`memory_reinforce`); the "Explain
  ranking" drawer reads the real trace keys (`name`/candidate lists/
  `text_preview`) instead of fixture-invented ones that rendered
  "undefined" and "[object Object]" in production.
- **Fixture-vs-serializer contract test** (`tests/test_fixture_contract.py`)
  pins the exact keys the Stream view consumes against both the real trace
  and the devserver fixtures — fixture drift now fails CI instead of QA.
- **ReferenceBank similarity math**: ChromaDB cosine distance is `1 − cos`,
  so similarity is `1 − dist` — the old `1 − dist/2` scored orthogonal
  chunks 0.5, above the retrieval floor, appending unrelated documents to
  essentially every search once any document existed.
- **BM25 tokenizer keeps standalone integers** (`port 8080`, `error 404`,
  `RTX 4090`) — the numeric pattern required a dot, silently gutting the
  exact-token channel for the very tokens it exists to catch.
- **Zombie sweep**: removed the never-called `ContrastiveUpdater` /
  `ContextBuilder` daemon wiring, the dead `AuthHealthASGI` wrapper, the
  chat-product config blocks (`backend`/`claude`/`gemini`/`lmstudio`) and
  `HydeConfig`; `NLIConfig.enabled` now defaults False with an honest
  "not wired" docstring; the HNSW index on `entries.embedding` is dropped
  (maintained on every insert, queried by nothing — similarity runs in
  Python over the hydrated bands).
- **Session titles no longer mis-attribute on POSIX** (found by CI run #1):
  a Windows-style client cwd parsed as one relative segment on Linux, so
  the git walk could title a session after the daemon's own repo.

### Added (2026-07-02 review P2 — quality infrastructure)
- **CI (GitHub Actions).** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the full suite on
  every master push and PR: pgvector/pg16 service container, CPU-torch
  install mirroring the daemon image, cached pip + HuggingFace models, then
  the documented offline invocation. Budget-guarded for a free-plan private
  repo: master+PR triggers only, cancel-in-progress concurrency, no
  artifacts (warm run ≈ 4-6 min of the 2,000 free minutes/month).
- **Retrieval golden set** (`tests/test_retrieval_golden.py`): 50 realistic
  memory/paraphrase-query pairs asserting recall@5 ≥ 0.92 and MRR ≥ 0.85 on
  the dense path plus top-3 ≥ 0.85 on BM25-fused identifier queries
  (measured baseline: 1.000 / 0.990 / 1.000) — the first thing on master
  that can catch a *ranking* regression, in under a second.
- **`ops/restore.ps1`** — the restore path is now a rehearsed procedure, not
  a code comment. Default mode restores the newest backup into a scratch
  database, reports per-table row counts against the live bank, and drops
  the scratch (live bank untouched); `-Apply` does the real restore with a
  pre-restore safety dump, daemon stop/start, and a health gate. Rehearsed
  2026-07-02 against the latest backup: PASSED.
- **Off-disk backup mirror**: `ops/backup.ps1` copies each artifact to
  `PSEUDOLIFE_BACKUP_MIRROR` (or `-MirrorDir`) with the same retention when
  set — point it at a folder on another physical disk. Mirror failure warns
  but never aborts (the primary backup already succeeded).

### Changed (2026-07-02 review H4 — autocommit connection)
- **Reads no longer leave the shared connection idle-in-transaction.** The
  storage connection runs autocommit; every mutation opens an explicit
  psycopg transaction block (`_txn` → `conn.transaction()`, nesting degrades
  to savepoints). Pre-fix, a bare read opened an implicit transaction that
  stayed open until the next mutator committed — pinning the xmin horizon
  overnight (blocking autovacuum) and holding ACCESS SHARE locks that
  blocked any concurrent DDL (the root cause of the test-suite
  lock-timeout ordering flake). `ensure_schema` now wraps its DDL in one
  `conn.transaction()` block so it stays atomic under both connection modes.

### Changed (2026-07-02 review P1 — per-slot persistence, schema v19)
- **The full-table snapshot rewrite is gone from the write path.** Every
  cortex/world/lesson write used to `DELETE FROM <table>` and reinsert every
  row (embeddings included) — O(claims × total rows) per dream sweep,
  permanent id churn and autovacuum pressure, and a structural blocker for
  the dormant OCC seam. The stores now track `dirty_slots`; saves persist
  only the mutated `(entity_norm, attribute_norm)` slots in one transaction
  (`replace_slot_facts` / `_world_facts` / `_lessons`,
  `sync_cortex_slots` / `sync_world_slots` / `sync_lesson_slots`). The
  supersession log + dream cursor ride a `meta_dirty` flag instead of being
  rewritten every save. Full snapshots remain for explicit `memory_save`,
  exit flush, and restore/migration — a belt-and-braces resync.
- **Schema v19:** partial unique indexes enforce one `current` row per slot
  on facts/world_facts/lessons (+ at-most-one `contested` on facts) — the
  invariant previously lived only in Python, so an additive `restore_from_pt`
  could silently create duplicate current rows. `ensure_schema` heals
  pre-existing duplicates first (keeps the most recently confirmed, demotes
  the rest — mirroring `CortexStore._reindex_current`).
- **HLC re-seeds from stored stamps at hydrate** (`hlc.observe` of the
  bank's high-water mark): a wall-clock step-back across restarts (NTP,
  resume) no longer lets history outrank new writes and park user
  corrections as contenders.
- **Auto-promoted facts are stamped** (`_promote_slots` now passes HLC +
  writer/session like `cortex_write`): unstamped rows could never supersede
  stamped ones and were retro-labeled `writer_id='legacy'` by the v11
  backfill on every boot.

### Fixed (2026-07-02 review P0 — six correctness fires)
- **MCP tools no longer block the daemon's event loop.** The SDK invokes sync
  tools inline on the uvicorn loop, so one long call (`memory_dream_run`,
  `document_ingest`, first-call model init) froze every other session,
  `/health`, and the Console — a Docker healthcheck could kill the daemon
  mid-dream. Every registered tool is now an async wrapper that dispatches
  its sync body via `anyio.to_thread.run_sync` (one change in `_tool()`;
  module-level fns stay sync for the Console/tests). Contextvars (writer /
  session attribution) propagate into the worker thread.
- **Postgres reconnect + honest `/health`.** A PG restart used to poison the
  daemon permanently (single connection, no reconnect anywhere) while
  `/health` — which never touched the DB — kept saying "ok". `storage.conn`
  is now a heal-on-next-use property; `/health` pings the DB on a dedicated
  short-lived connection and reports 503 `status:degraded` when it's
  unreachable. `_txn` rollback on a dead connection no longer masks the
  original exception. `ensure_schema`'s DDL timeouts are now `SET LOCAL` —
  the old session-wide `SET` silently capped every runtime query at 30s.
- **`access_count` now counts returned results, not candidates.** Bands
  bumped every band-local top-k candidate (up to 8 per band per query,
  pre-filter), corrupting promotion, MTT retention, and eviction scoring at
  the source. The bump moved to the final merged top-k in `cms.retrieve`.
- **Eviction prefers superseded entries.** A correction arrives with
  near-zero surprise while the stale fact it replaced keeps a decayed-but-
  larger one, so surprise-driven eviction destroyed corrections and kept the
  stale facts. Superseded entries now score 0.05× — always the cheaper loss.
- **Graph ingestion gated at the source** (the junk root cause, previously
  patched detection-side only): dream relations drop endpoints matching the
  known junk classes (`junk_name_reason`: concat-artifacts, bare numbers,
  status words) before entity creation; fact-write subject nodes get the same
  gate; `dream.min_relation_confidence` default 0.0 → **0.2** (hard
  type-violations score ≤0.175 and are now dropped, not written-then-cleaned);
  and `upsert_edge(revive=False)` on the dream path makes human removals
  sticky — an agent re-assertion no longer resurrects a superseded edge.
- **Dream poison-pill quarantine + idempotent re-dreams.** A deterministically
  failing entry used to stall consolidation forever (same batch retried every
  sweep) while each retry re-confirmed the batch prefix, ratcheting agent-
  guess confidence toward ~0.98. Now: three strikes per entry → quarantine
  (cursor advances past it), and an already-traced (slot, source-entry) pair
  is skipped on re-extraction instead of re-confirmed.
- **User config.yaml keys are respected.** `_apply_mcp_defaults` clobbered
  five knobs unconditionally after load (`surprise_threshold`,
  `meta_filter.enabled`, `recency_base_half_life_s`, `traces.retention_boost`,
  `embedding.batch_size`) — the YAML knobs were dead. Defaults now overlay
  only keys the user left unset; `load_config` also gained the missing
  `memory.traces` / `memory.deep_dream` sections.
- **Lesson signals survive empty synthesis.** `synthesize_lessons` consumed
  the outcome-signal queue even when the extraction wrote nothing — silently
  losing the only feeder for procedural memory. Signals are now consumed only
  when at least one lesson landed.

### Added
- **Session-scoped episodes (correct attribution + clean names).** Episodes are now
  keyed to a **stable per-session id** instead of a single global `current_id`, so a
  new session (e.g. a different project) no longer auto-closes another's open episode
  and each `memory_store` is stamped to *its own* session's episode even under
  concurrency (`EpisodeManager` tracks one open episode per `session_key`). The session
  id is the transport's `mcp-session-id` — **stable per session for a direct-HTTP
  client** (the daemon's shipped transport), or a stdio shim's `X-PL-Session`
  (`writer_context` prefers it). **Lifecycle is daemon-owned:** because a direct-HTTP
  client has no shim/hook in the path, the daemon **lazily opens** a session episode on
  the first store of a new session id (so empty sessions never create a husk) and an
  **idle reaper** closes it once inactive — firing the end-of-session dream, or pruning
  it if empty (`PSEUDOLIFE_SESSION_IDLE_SECONDS`, default 30 min). The
  `SessionStart`/`SessionEnd` `episode-start`/`episode-end` hooks are therefore obsolete
  (removed; the legacy CLI + shim path remain for stdio clients). Titles are
  `{project} - {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}` (shim, from cwd) or `session - {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}`
  (daemon, generic — direct-HTTP carries no project signal; set `TZ` in `ops/.env` for
  local-time titles). New `storage.delete_episode` +
  `service.episode_prune_empty(include_open=False)` + `POST /api/episodes/prune` provide
  a one-shot cleanup for the empty/spurious husks the old single-pointer model
  accumulated. New `memory_session_title(title)` tool lets an agent name its
  session episode (since the daemon can't see the client's project dir); the
  shim no longer titles GUI-client sessions after a system dir (`system32` →
  generic `session`).
- **Atlas review queue: granular per-item bulk actions.** The `dubious_edge` (Prune),
  `unattributed` (Assign) and `test_artifact` (Delete) findings — previously
  all-or-nothing over the whole list — now render a filterable, capped-scroll checkbox
  list with "select all (filtered)" / "clear" and a live count on the action button
  (opt-in: nothing selected by default), so you act on exactly the chosen subset. The
  `orphan` finding is now actionable too (Delete + Assign on the selection). Pure
  frontend (`atlas_review.js` `selectableList`) — the findings already carried their
  full lists and the handlers already post per item.
- **Atlas review queue: entity provenance.** New `GET /api/graph/entity-provenance`
  (`service.entity_provenance` + `storage.entries_for_entity`) returns an entity's
  project attribution (`entity_sources`: source · count · origin) and the MIRAS
  source entries behind its facts (band · source · ts · text), bridging
  `facts.entity_id → entity_norm → memory_traces → entries`. In the Atlas Review
  panel every entity name is now clickable to lazy-load a provenance drawer, so a
  human can judge a merge/junk/link finding from real evidence, not names alone.
  (Source entries carry no user/action/agent tier — that lives on facts/edges — so
  the drawer shows band + `entity_sources` origin, not a per-entry tier.)
- **Session-start briefing (P1.7).** New `memory_briefing` tool + `pseudolife-mcp
  briefing` CLI assemble a "what your memory is unsure about" (graph surprises +
  questions) + "lessons from past work" (avoid/prefer) block. Wire the CLI to a
  SessionStart hook (README) to auto-inject it; it never auto-starts the daemon
  and prints nothing on a cold bank.
- **Easy hook install + safe updates.** `pseudolife-mcp briefing --hook-json`
  emits the SessionStart `additionalContext` payload; `ops/install-hook.ps1` wires
  it idempotently alongside existing hooks (backs up `settings.json` first);
  `ops/update.ps1` does a backup-first, daemon-only (`--no-deps`) rebuild that
  never touches Postgres/the extractor or runs `down -v`.

### Changed
- **Dream cadence: faster post-activity consolidation.** `memory.dream.idle_seconds`
  default 1800 → 600, so the cortex consolidates ~10 min after you go quiet (still
  never mid-session — any store resets idle). The quiescence gate logic is
  unchanged. The README "Dreaming" section now documents the concrete cadence
  (8 / 600s / 600s, daemon-only) and the on-demand `memory_fact_set` /
  `memory_dream_run` paths.
- **Tool-surface gate + redundancy trim.** `PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_TOOLSET=core` exposes a
  lean 15-tool core set (default `full` = unchanged). Folded `memory_trace` into
  `memory_search(explain=True)` and dropped `get_neighbors` (its `relation_filter`
  moved onto `memory_graph`); `memory_path` retained. 48 → 46 tools at the time
  of this change (the surface has since grown again with the deep-dream /
  entity-consolidation additions below — see README for the current count).
- **Retention bench made honest (P1.6).** `evals/retention_bench.py` now models a
  heavy-tailed reinforcement workload with `access_count` coupled to reinforcement
  (reinforcing *is* accessing). The honest re-derivation keeps `retention_boost=1.0`
  (the largest boost with ~no recency displacement) but shows it's a modest nudge on
  top of the automatic access-coupling — not the dramatic knee the prior synthetic
  bench implied. Default unchanged.
- **Right-sized the continuum bands.** The default `continuum` preset's total
  capacity drops 44,000 → ~5,250 (e.g. `slow` 8000→1500), all still well above a
  personal bank's fill — so eviction/curation engages in ~1 year (the `slow`
  band) instead of ~decades, with no data loss on existing personal banks. Raise
  the caps (or use `preset: custom`) for high-volume / multi-agent deployments.

### Fixed
- **Atlas review queue rendered deep-dream findings unusably.** The panel predated
  the deep-dream proposal shapes: `merge_candidate` (data in `f.merges`),
  `proposed_link` (`f.links`), and `junk_candidate` (`f.entities` as objects) showed
  no detail or literal `[object Object]`, and their action buttons were dead (read
  `f.entities` → `[undefined, undefined]`) or posted malformed bodies. The renderer
  (`atlas_review.js`) now understands all finding shapes and surfaces the
  already-computed signals (jaccard / similarity / confidence / reason / rationale);
  the handler (`views/atlas.js`) dispatches per item to the id-keyed
  `accept-entity-merge` / `accept-entity-junk` / `reject-entity-proposal` /
  `accept-proposal` / `reject-proposal` endpoints. `graph_review.proposed_links` now
  carries the `edge_proposals` id so links are accept/reject-able.
- **"Merge duplicate entities" modal clipped long names.** The footer put the full
  entity name in each button (`Keep "<name>"`); long path-like names overflowed the
  fixed-width modal (`overflow:hidden`) and were cut off. The modal now shows both
  full names (labelled A/B, wrapping) in the body and uses short, middle-ellipsised
  button labels; `.modal-foot` also wraps (`flex-wrap`) as a safety net.
- **Deep-dream merge proposals were noisy; `A<->B` artifacts were unhandled.** The
  entity-merge classifier proposed a merge whenever one name's token set was a subset
  of the other's, so single generic tokens drove false merges (`memory_graph→Graph`,
  `bank→live bank`, `LIVE→live daemon`) and real entities were merged *into*
  concatenated extraction artifacts (`Phase 2 plan → Phase 1 plan<->Phase 2 plan`).
  `_name_contains` now requires the contained token set to have ≥2 tokens and excludes
  any concat-artifact endpoint; a new degree-agnostic `concat-artifact` junk rule
  (`_is_concat_artifact`) surfaces the `A<->B` nodes for deletion instead.
- **A failed statement could wedge the whole daemon (connection poisoning).** The
  daemon holds one long-lived psycopg connection, but only 3 of ~30 mutating methods
  in `storage/postgres.py` rolled back on error — so any raised statement (lock
  timeout, FK violation) left the connection `InFailedSqlTransaction`, breaking every
  subsequent tool call until a restart. Every mutator now funnels through one shared
  `_txn()` context manager (commit on success, rollback on any exception). The
  deep-dream apply loop is unaffected by design (each op is idempotent + re-runnable).
- **`world_cortex` / `lessons` supersession ignored HLC ordering.** Both stores
  superseded on value-difference alone, unlike the personal cortex; they now gate on
  the HLC (an out-of-order write with an older stamp can't clobber a newer value).
  Dormant under the shipped single-writer (every write gets a fresh monotonic tick),
  live under the future multi-writer path — parity with `cortex._should_supersede`.
- **`exact_duplicate_pairs` could auto-merge (no review) two `A<->B` concat
  artifacts**, and `merge_entity` over-counted / FK-crashed on a stale endpoint. The
  auto-merge path now excludes concat artifacts, and `merge_entity` returns a graceful
  no-op when either endpoint no longer exists instead of raising.

### Security
- **Stored-XSS via world-fact `source_url`.** A citation URL is agent/LLM-authored
  (often distilled from fetched web content), so a prompt-injected `javascript:` /
  `data:` scheme could execute when an operator clicked the "source" link in the
  Cortex Console. Now blocked at both ends: `service.world_write` rejects any non-
  `http(s)` scheme at write time (`{"action":"rejected"}`) so the payload never lands,
  and `views/world.js` allowlists `http(s)` at render time (bad URLs show as inert text).
- **`ops/restore_from_pt.py` unpickled snapshots with `weights_only=False`** (CWE-502),
  inconsistent with `storage/migrate.py`'s own guard on the same file format. Now
  `weights_only=True`, so restoring a stale/tampered `.pt` bank can't execute code.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-25 — graph foundation

### Added
- **Provenance-as-link (Phase 1)** — the dream now links each consolidated fact-slot
  to the dense episodes it came from (`memory_traces`, keyed on the stable slot);
  facts surface `source_entries`, and new `memory_get` / `memory_reinforce` tools
  dereference and strengthen them.
- **Cortex Console (web UI)** — an operator dashboard served by the daemon at
  `/ui/` (new `pseudolife_memory/web/`: a pure-ASGI `/api` REST layer 1:1 over
  `MemoryService` + a no-build vanilla SPA). Tabs: Observatory (health/stats,
  MIRAS band continuum, dream gauges), Cortex (fact review with provenance +
  version-history timeline + contested-fact resolve), World, Lessons, Episodes,
  Stream (search + ranking-trace debugger), Graph (force-directed visualiser +
  table view), and a Console config editor (28 knobs, live-vs-restart, atomic
  save with backup). `/api/*` is bearer-gated like `/mcp`; `/ui` + `/health`
  stay open. Offline-first (vendored OFL fonts, no CDN, no build step). A
  fixture-backed `pseudolife_memory.web.devserver` renders the UI without
  Postgres for development.
- **Graph insight layer** — `dream` now computes graph communities (persisted),
  god-nodes, surprising connections, and suggested questions. New read-only
  tools `memory_digest` and `memory_communities`; `memory_graph` nodes carry a
  `community` field.
- **`memory_recall`** — read-only multi-hop graph-traversal retrieval (MemCoT
  loop). Seeds from the query, walks the knowledge graph up to `hops`
  iterations (max 5), and returns entities, edges, paths, and supporting texts.
  Mechanical seed driver by default (deterministic, no LLM call); set
  `PSEUDOLIFE_RECALL_DRIVER=llm` to use the dream endpoint for seed resolution.
  `low_confidence: true` signals no seed matched — fall back to `memory_search`.
- **`memory_path` / `get_neighbors`** — two focused read-only graph MCP tools.
  `memory_path` returns the shortest path between two entities (targeted
  bidirectional search over the read-model, `max_hops` cutoff); `get_neighbors`
  returns an entity's 1-hop neighbours with an optional relation filter.

### Changed
- `memory_recall` mechanical seeder is now **query-first** — it seeds the
  question's subject(s) and uses search-hit matches only as a fallback,
  eliminating cross-talk noise on populous banks (bench: seed precision 1.0 vs
  0.262, zero answer-recall loss, ~4× fewer graph calls). `recall.driver=llm`
  unchanged.
- `memory_recall` now **hub-gates** graph expansion (graphify-derived) — high-degree
  hub entities are still returned as results but are not expanded *through*, with
  degree-aware frontier ordering and a per-hop budget. Cuts blast radius on
  hub-adjacent queries with no recall loss (bench: mean −118 tokens/q, −6.7
  entities/q, zero recall regression). Adaptive threshold
  (`recall.hub_percentile` / `recall.hub_floor`); disable via `recall.hub_gate=false`.
- The graph-insight digest now also refreshes on a `dream_run` with **no memory
  backlog**, so manual graph edits (cleanup, direct `graph_relate`) are reflected
  in `memory_digest` / `memory_communities` without waiting for a memory-bearing
  dream.
- Dream `exclude_sources` default now also skips `"status"` and `"log"` — store
  verbose status/log dumps under those sources to keep them searchable (in the
  bands) without the dream mining them into knowledge-graph clutter.
- Graph layer: single source of truth (Postgres `entities` hub + NetworkX
  read-model) behind a swappable `GraphStore` port. Apache AGE removed.
- **Dream extractor default → Gemma 4 E2B QAT (UD-Q4_K_XL).** Switched the baked
  sidecar model (`ops/Dockerfile.extractor` `MODEL_URL`) from PTQ Q4_K_M to the
  quantization-aware-trained UD-Q4_K_XL — smaller (2.44 vs ~2.9 GB) and faster on
  CPU at identical quality. Quant ladder (2026-06-24, `evals/`): facts gold 1.0 /
  stale 0.0, relations F1 0.75 (separate), lessons 5/6 — all equal to the old
  Q4_K_M, ~17–40% faster to consolidate. Lighter GGUF quants are dominated:
  UD-Q3_K_XL regresses relations (F1 0.62) and is bigger+slower; UD-Q2_K_XL
  craters lesson synthesis (3/6 — inverts polarity/outcome) and is the slowest.
  GGUF size floor is ~2.2 GB; genuine sub-1 GB needs the LiteRT 2-bit/mmap mobile
  build (a separate runtime, not wired here).

### Removed
- `memory_graph_query` (raw read-only Cypher) MCP tool and the `pseudolife-mcp
  age-sync` CLI mode. Multi-hop queries are served by `memory_graph`
  (neighborhood + derived/inverse edges + shortest path). The Postgres image no
  longer requires the Apache AGE extension. Run `ops/migrate_drop_age.py` once
  (back up first) to drop the AGE graph + extension from an existing bank — it
  supersedes the v0.4 `ops/migrate_v04.py` collision-fix migration.

## [0.5.1] — dream resilience

### Fixed
- **The dream stopped skipping memories on a failed extraction.** The extractor
  masked failures (timeout / network / malformed response) as an empty `[]`
  result, so `dream_run` advanced its cursor past those memories permanently —
  on the live CPU Gemma sidecar this skipped every dream during a too-short
  timeout window. `OpenAICompatExtractor` now **raises `ExtractorError`** on
  failure; `dream_run` **holds the cursor** (returns `extractor_failed`) so the
  memories are retried next sweep, and `synthesize_lessons` already leaves its
  signals pending. A genuine empty result (a successful call with no canonical
  facts) still writes nothing and advances, as before.
- **Extractor timeout was too short for CPU inference.** The default CPU sidecar
  (Gemma E2B Q4) generates at ~30 tok/s, so a full generation easily exceeded the
  old 20s timeout → `claims:0`. `extractor_timeout_seconds` default 20s → **240s**
  and `extractor_max_tokens` 1024 → **2048** (headroom for dense batches + slower
  end-user laptops). Both are now env-overridable —
  `PSEUDOLIFE_DREAM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` / `PSEUDOLIFE_DREAM_MAX_TOKENS` (set in
  `ops/docker-compose.yml`) — alongside the existing `_BASE_URL` / `_MODEL` /
  `_API_KEY`.

### Added
- **`ops/wslconfig.example`** — a `.wslconfig` template that caps Docker
  Desktop's WSL2 VM (the stack needs ~2–4 GB resident; WSL2 otherwise balloons to
  ~50% of host RAM and caches without releasing). Copy to `%USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig`
  and `wsl --shutdown` to apply.

## [0.5.0] — cosine spine

### Changed
- **Removed the test-time-trained neural memory; bands are now plain cosine
  vector stores.** An A/B eval ([`docs/2026-06-21-neural-memory-investigation.md`])
  showed the MIRAS neural-retrieval blend *underperformed* pure cosine at every
  scale (the L2-self-reconstruction MLP over frozen embeddings is a regime
  mismatch for standalone retrieval — TITANS/HOPE are end-to-end sequence
  models). `band.retrieve` is now pure cosine; the store gate uses **novelty**
  surprise (`1 − max cos(x, existing)`). Deleted `memory/miras/objectives.py`,
  `update_rules.py`, `modules.py`, the HOPE chained-read, the neural-blend
  config (`neural_blend_weight` / `neural_warmup_updates`), `chain_residual`,
  and the dead `MemoryMLP` / `TitansMemoryBank`. The contrastive feature keeps
  suppression (drops the band-MLP step). `memory_stats` per-band fields no
  longer include `objective` / `update_rule` / `base_lr` / `memory_module`.
  `weights.pt` now persists only counters (no MLP weights); legacy state with
  weight blocks loads tolerantly (entries restored, weights ignored). The full
  neural machinery is archived on the `archive/neural-memory-titans` branch
  for a future sequence-model experiment. `MIRASBandSpec` keeps only capacity /
  cadence / promotion / eviction.

### Fixed
- **Durable-save failures no longer silent (F3).** A failed cortex/world/lessons
  snapshot used to be swallowed with a `logger.warning` while the tool call
  returned success — silent data loss in a memory system. The saves now raise
  `PersistenceError` (surfaced to the caller on tool paths; the background
  autosave/flush threads already catch, so they survive) and bump a
  health-visible `persist_errors` counter. The AGE *mirror* stays best-effort
  (rebuildable via age-sync) — only content persistence is hardened.
- **Version/schema drift (F5).** `pyproject` version `0.2.0 → 0.4.0`; `/health`
  now reports `schema` from `SCHEMA_META_VERSION` (was hardcoded `8`) plus the
  new `persist_errors`; the `mcp_server.py` header rewritten to describe the
  HTTP-daemon + auth architecture (was the obsolete v0.1 stdio/no-auth model);
  clarified that `cortex.SCHEMA_VERSION` is the file-mode snapshot format number,
  distinct from the Postgres `SCHEMA_META_VERSION`.

### Added
- **Writer-aware temporal memory (schema v11).** Every canonical write (cortex,
  world, lessons) now carries a temporal/provenance stamp: `tx_time` (write
  time), `valid_time` (event time — a lesson inherits its source signal's
  observation time, not the dream's write time: bitemporal), an
  `(hlc_phys, hlc_logical)` **Hybrid Logical Clock** that is the ordering
  authority for supersession (monotonic, immune to wall-clock steps — "newer
  wins" no longer depends on jittery wall time), and `writer_id`/`session_id`.
  The daemon reads an `X-PL-Writer` header per request (the shim forwards
  `PSEUDOLIFE_WRITER_ID`) and a per-connection `session_id`, so concurrent
  sessions/agents are distinguishable. Reads surface the stamp + a human `age`;
  new `memory_history(entity, attribute)` returns the per-slot version timeline.
  A dormant `write_mode=occ` seam (`version` column + `replace_facts_occ` stub)
  is laid for a future multi-process writer (Phase 2; raises `NotImplementedError`).
  **Collision fix:** the AGE graph is renamed off the DB role name
  (`pseudolife` → `pseudolife_graph`), every connection pins `search_path` to
  `public`, and a guarded backup-first migration (`ops/migrate_v04.py`, later
  superseded by `ops/migrate_drop_age.py` when AGE was removed) renames legacy
  graphs + drops shadow tables. `ops/retire_by_writer.py` supersedes a rogue
  writer's rows. Design + plan:
  `docs/specs/2026-06-21-writer-aware-temporal-memory-{design,plan}.md`.
- **Procedural / outcome memory — "lessons" (schema v10).** A fourth memory
  layer beside the personal and world cortex that learns from the agent's *own
  work*: what worked, what was a dead end, and what the user corrected. Keyed by
  `(task-type, aspect)`, each lesson carries an `outcome`
  (`success`/`failure`/`correction`) and a `polarity` (`+` do / `-` avoid) in its
  own `lessons` table (blast-radius isolated). Capture is cheap and in-session
  (`memory_outcome` logs a *signal*; user-tier `memory_fact_set` corrections are
  auto-tagged); synthesis is **single-writer** — the dream's LLM extractor distils
  accumulated `outcome_signals` into lessons (`extract_lessons`), with no
  deterministic floor (no extractor ⇒ no lessons, signals retained + age-pruned).
  Lessons are **graph-traversable**: a task-type becomes an `etype='task-type'`
  entity and each lesson adds a `prefers`/`avoids` edge (two new builtin
  relations) to the tool/source it concerns. New tools: `memory_outcome`,
  `memory_lesson_search` (embedding-on-query), `memory_lessons`,
  `memory_lesson_forget`. Config under `memory.lessons`. The auto-injected
  "lessons from past work" prompt block, an outcome-coloured graph view, and a
  Cypher-side AGE edge-property upgrade are deferred follow-ons. Design:
  `docs/specs/2026-06-20-procedural-outcome-memory-design.md`.
- **Dream consolidation (Tiers 0–2).** Pull recent associative memories, extract
  canonical `(entity, attribute, value)` facts, write them to the cortex, and
  advance a monotonic cursor so each memory is consolidated once (session-agnostic
  — no "session finished" event needed). A pluggable `DreamExtractor`
  (`memory/dream.py`) feeds one shared `service.dream_run` driver that owns cursor
  discipline. (Single-writer cortex — see Changed — makes the LLM dream the sole
  automatic writer; the regex is opt-in only.) Three tiers:
  - **Tier 0** — `memory_dream_run` (regex floor, headless, no LLM, on-box/free).
  - **Tier 1** — agent-driven via `memory_dream_pull` / `memory_dream_status` /
    `memory_dream_commit` and a copy-in `/dream` command
    (`examples/commands/dream.md`).
  - **Tier 2** — `OpenAICompatExtractor` + a daemon background sweep that fires on
    a configurable backlog+quiescence trigger, pointed at any OpenAI-compatible
    endpoint (Ollama, LM Studio, Haiku, OpenRouter, self-hosted) via
    `PSEUDOLIFE_DREAM_BASE_URL` / `_MODEL` / `_API_KEY`.

  Eligible sources and the trigger thresholds are configurable under
  `memory.dream`. Design: `docs/specs/2026-06-15-pluggable-dream-extractor-design.md`.
- **Abstention signal.** `memory_search` now returns `low_confidence` — `True`
  when the top score falls below `memory.search_confidence_floor` (default `0.0`
  = off), so the agent can choose to abstain rather than answer from a weak
  match. A cortex hit always overrides it (a canonical fact *is* the answer).
- **One-shot dream sweep.** `memory_dream_run(limit=…)` consolidates the whole
  eligible backlog in a single call (omit for the configured batch size).
- **Opt-in CPU LLM extractor sidecar.** A llama.cpp `compose --profile extractor`
  service (`ops/Dockerfile.extractor`, Gemma 4 E2B baked in) exposes an
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint for higher-quality dream consolidation, off by
  default. Plus `evals/` — an extractor-ladder benchmark that picks the minimum
  viable model (verdict: Gemma 4 E2B clears; see `evals/README.md`).
- **Tunable cortex abstention guard.** `memory.cortex.guard_min_score` (default
  `0.3` = prior hard-coded behaviour) sets the score at/above which a cortex fact
  counts as a confident answer and suppresses `low_confidence`. Raising it lets
  weak topically-adjacent facts stop blocking abstention. Calibrated as a pair
  with `search_confidence_floor`; the `evals/` guard sweep recommends
  `guard_min_score = 0.65` + `search_confidence_floor = 0.70` (doubles abstention
  recall at zero false-abstain). Behaviour-preserving at the default.
- **Dream slot resolver (off by default).** `memory.cortex.dream_slot_match_threshold`
  (default `0.0` = off) lets the dream pass map a paraphrased `(entity, attribute)`
  onto an existing slot (value-free `slot_embedding`, schema v8, additive) before
  writing, to catch small-model supersession forks. Calibration found no
  measurable benefit on the benchmark (stale-leak flat, a false-merge at `0.80`):
  the residual fragmentation traces to the deterministic regex auto-promote, not
  paraphrase — see `docs/specs/2026-06-19-single-writer-cortex-design.md` for the
  structural fix. Shipped off; enable only with the false-merge risk in mind.

### Changed
- **Single-writer cortex.** The LLM **dream** pass is now the sole *automatic*
  writer of canonical facts (plus explicit `memory_fact_set`). The deterministic
  regex auto-promote on `store` (`memory.cortex.auto_promote`) now defaults
  **off**, and the `dream_run` regex fallback is removed — an extractor that
  yields nothing writes nothing. Rationale: the regex mis-splits compound entity
  names (`"payments database host"` → `payments` / `database host`) and, running
  alongside the LLM dream, fragments one fact across sibling slots — the real
  cause of the residual stale-leak, not small-model paraphrase. New
  `NoOpExtractor` is the default when no extractor LLM is configured; the daemon
  logs a startup warning in that case. Behaviour change: a plain `store()` no
  longer populates the cortex. Design:
  `docs/specs/2026-06-19-single-writer-cortex-design.md`.
- **Extractor sidecar default-on.** `ops/docker-compose.yml` now starts the Gemma
  CPU extractor with the stack (dropped its `profiles` gate) and routes dream
  consolidation to it. Clearer names (anti-PEBKAC): compose project `pseudolife-mcp`
  (was the folder default `ops`); containers `pseudolife-mcp-{postgres,daemon,extractor}`;
  new-install volumes default to `pseudolife-mcp-{bank,state}`, env-overridable so
  existing installs keep `ops_pseudolife_*` via `ops/.env`.

### Added (cleanup tooling)
- **`ops/dedup_cortex.py`.** One-time, dry-run-first, reversible cleanup that
  collapses paraphrase sibling slots left by past auto-promotes
  (`MemoryService.cortex_dedup` / `CortexStore.dedup_siblings`): clusters current
  slots by value-free slot-embedding cosine, keeps the canonical (provenance tier,
  then recency), retires the rest (audit trail kept). Back up before `--apply`.

### Fixed
- **Reasoning models in `OpenAICompatExtractor`.** Thinking models (Qwen3, etc.)
  spent the entire token budget on a `<think>` trace and returned empty content,
  silently falling back to the regex floor. The extractor now sends
  `chat_template_kwargs:{enable_thinking:false}` and tolerantly parses the
  outermost JSON object (stripping ```json fences / leading prose). Non-thinking
  templates (e.g. Gemma) ignore the kwarg; extraction got both faster and more
  accurate across the board.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-14

The v0.2 line moves the bank off local files and onto a single-writer daemon
backed by Postgres, and adds a canonical-fact cortex and a typed knowledge
graph on top of the associative continuum.

### Added
- **Daemon + shim architecture.** A long-lived memory daemon owns the bank and
  serves MCP over HTTP on `127.0.0.1:8765`; every Claude Code session attaches
  through a torch-free stdio shim (`pseudolife-mcp`) that auto-starts the daemon
  if absent. Three CLI modes: `serve` (daemon), default (shim), `embedded`
  (the v0.1 in-process server — no daemon, no Postgres).
- **Postgres source of truth.** Postgres 16 + pgvector (bundled
  `ops/docker-compose.yml`, host port `5433`, external volume so `down -v` can't
  wipe the bank) is now durable storage; the in-memory MIRAS bands are a
  write-through cache hydrated at startup. Single writer = concurrent sessions
  can't clobber each other; entries are transactional.
- **Cortex (canonical facts).** Slot-keyed `(entity, attribute) -> current value`
  store with supersession-not-decay: `memory_fact_get` / `memory_fact_set` /
  `memory_fact_resolve` / `memory_fact_forget` / `memory_facts`. Slot-shaped
  facts in any `memory_store` auto-promote at a 0.5 confidence floor.
- **Provenance contenders.** Cortex facts carry a tier (`user > action > agent`);
  a weaker-tier write that conflicts with a stronger-tier fact is parked as a
  contender (surfaced in get/search) rather than silently overwriting, and
  settled with `memory_fact_resolve`.
- **Knowledge graph.** Typed entity graph (`memory_graph`, `memory_graph_relate`,
  `memory_graph_unrelate`, `memory_relation_define`, `memory_alias`) with a
  closed relation vocabulary, soft type hints, and transitive/inverse closure
  computed on read. Apache AGE mirror enables read-only openCypher via
  `memory_graph_query`.
- **World-knowledge cortex.** Durable cited/dated facts about external reality,
  persisted in Postgres and exposed through the daemon's MCP tools.
- **Tier C** (carried from late 0.1): episodes (`memory_episode_*`),
  multi-valued tags, and the consolidation workflow
  (`memory_consolidation_candidates` + `memory_consolidate`).
- **Optional retrieval boosters:** cross-encoder reranker (`rerank=True`) and a
  stdlib BM25 hybrid lexical pool (`bm25=True`), both off by default.
- **LAN sharing.** Run the daemon with `PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0` and a
  `PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_TOKEN`; the daemon refuses to bind a non-loopback host without
  a token, and Postgres stays loopback-only.
- **Ops:** `ops/install-autostart.ps1` (Task Scheduler logon task),
  `ops/backup.ps1` (rotating `pg_dump`), `age-sync` to heal a drifted AGE mirror.

### Fixed
- **Alias-aware cortex lookup.** `memory_fact_get` / `cortex_lookup` now resolve
  entity aliases through the graph before reporting a miss, so a fact stored
  under a canonical name (e.g. `dev-box`) is reachable via any bound alias
  (e.g. `4090`) — honouring the documented contract that every fact lookup
  resolves aliases first.
- **Test isolation against the AGE schema.** PG-backed test fixtures now pin
  `search_path` to `public` before schema/truncate work and reap leaked
  backends. Previously, once a test created the AGE graph (whose schema name
  `pseudolife` equals the DB role), unqualified table names resolved to
  graph-schema shadow tables and `TRUNCATE` cleared the wrong ones — rows leaked
  across tests and `pytest tests/` showed order-dependent failures. The full
  suite (300 tests) is now green on repeat runs.

### Migration
- On first daemon run, a pre-v8 `cms_state.pt` in `PSEUDOLIFE_MCP_DATA_DIR` is
  auto-migrated into Postgres; the originals are renamed `*.pre-v8.bak` (never
  deleted). The MCP build is not save-compatible with the desktop Pseudolife app.

## [0.1.0] - Initial release

- In-process stdio MCP server exposing the neural memory layer: the MIRAS
  8-tier continuum (working → forever), ChromaDB reference bank, supersession,
  and contrastive learning. File-mode persistence (`cms_state.pt` + ChromaDB);
  no daemon, no Postgres. `memory_store` / `memory_search` / `memory_recent` /
  `memory_supersede` / `memory_delete` / `memory_stats` / `memory_save` plus the
  document RAG tools.
