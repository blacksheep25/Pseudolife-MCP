"""Forgetting sweep — is a swept bank better than a wide one? (2026-09-05)

Preregistered offline analysis; the contract is
``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-05-forgetting-sweep-preregistration.md``
— read that first. This module implements it exactly: no arms, metrics or
statistics beyond what the spec states.

The 2026-08-15 distractor-scale probe measured what accumulation costs
(evidence-in-top-6 0.830 at 1x → 0.597 at 15x) and what a *perfect* sweep
could recover, and left its own follow-up open: "no experiment forced
eviction and asked which victims to pick; none asked whether NOT evicting
(a wider bank) beats it."

This probe holds that construction fixed — same 78 knowledge-update
dumps, same fixed rotation, same offline mirror
(``band_ablation.select_topk``, flat policy, recency off, BM25 on) — and
varies only the sweep applied to the pool before selection. Six arms:
``none`` (the control, which must reproduce the 2026-08-15 artifact
exactly), the three shipped retention policies scored through the real
``RetentionPolicy.source_weighted_score``, a seeded ``random`` floor, and
an evidence-preserving ``oracle`` ceiling. Two per-question capacities:
the 1x pool size (``C1``) and the 3x pool size (``C3``).

Usage (repo root, venv python; CPU-only, no GPU/judge/daemon needed):

    python evals/forgetting_sweep_probe.py

Writes ``evals/results/forgetting-sweep-probe-20260905.json`` and refuses
to overwrite it without ``--force``.
