"""Extractor op-adoption probe (dev-only, unjudged).

The C2 gate found the ceiling extractor never adopts the claim-level
``op`` field from an appended prompt block (0/78 banks, 0/4 direct probe;
``evals/results/c2-gate-verdict.json``), so the block was held out of the
shipped prompt. This probe iterates PROMPT FORMATS cheaply — a fixed note
battery with known membership/decoy structure, one extractor call per
variant, no judge — to find a format the extractor demonstrably adopts
before anything expensive is pre-registered.

Scores per variant:
  * adoption   — fraction of expected-op claims carrying the correct op
                 ("add"/"remove" on membership notes).
  * decoy_ok   — fraction of decoy value-update claims correctly WITHOUT
                 a membership op (plain claim, or op:"set" under variants
                 whose schema requires an op on every claim).
  * valid_json — extractor returned parseable claims for the battery.

Output is never judged — the fast server config is acceptable here; the
winning variant must be re-confirmed on the reproducible config before
any gate run. Writes ``evals/results/op-probe-<tag>.json`` (benches
persist by default).
