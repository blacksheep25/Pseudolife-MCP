"""Re-judge an existing LongMemEval run's recorded answers with a second
judge family.

The 2026-09-04 500-question run (`raglite-all-fresh`) is the first
whole-benchmark memory-arm win this project has measured — hybrid beats the
naive RAG control by +0.040 (paired sign-flip permutation p 0.015, 41 W /
21 L). It was judged by one instrument only: the local Qwen3.8-27B server.
The standing rule (CLAUDE.md, "Publishing a benchmark number") is that a
claim reaching the README first runs under two independent judge families,
because determinism is not validity — the retired BEAM cascade 0.936
replicated at std 0.0000 three times and still did not survive a judge
swap.

`beam_rejudge.py` does this for BEAM's rubric-scored rows; this is the
LongMemEval half. Retrieval and answering are NOT re-run: the recorded
per-arm responses are replayed through a headless ``claude -p`` judge (the
Max-plan CLI contract, no API key — `CliJudge` is imported from
`beam_rejudge` rather than re-implemented) using the harness's OWN judge
prompts, imported from `longmemeval_bench` so the only term that changes
is the judge model. Any movement is therefore pure judge effect.

The source artifact is never touched. Output goes to

  * ``<source>.rejudge-<tag>.jsonl`` — the same rows with
    ``{arm}_correct_<tag>`` added and the original ``{arm}_correct``
    preserved beside it, so every comparison pairs within-row
  * ``<source>.rejudge-<tag>.summary.json`` — per-arm and per-type accuracy
    under both judges, item-level agreement per arm, the gold-leak
    exclusion (ids recorded), and the CLI call/error counts
  * ``<source>.rejudge-<tag>.arms-vs-rag.json`` — the SAME paired
    comparison the original claim was made from, produced by
    ``beam_within_run_pairs.py`` with ``--score-key correct_<tag>``, so the
    two numbers are read off identical arithmetic

A seeded stability sample (N (row, arm) pairs judged twice) is reported
alongside: a CLI judge, unlike the pinned q8_0 server, is not
bit-reproducible, and its own flip rate is the control floor that bounds
what any judge-to-judge delta can claim.
