"""Epistemic bench — score the SERVED CONTEXT, not a model answer.

Design + preregistration:
``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-05-epistemic-bench-design.md``.

Every published retrieval number this project has asks one question — did
the served context contain the gold string — and on that question the fact
spine ties naive RAG (LongMemEval-500 rag 0.690 vs cascade 0.692; BEAM-100K
rag 0.6425 vs hybrid 0.6226). This bench asks the other question: does the
served context tell the agent WHICH value is current, how old it is,
whether it was retracted, and when nothing is known at all.

Judge-free by construction. Each metric is a deterministic predicate over
one arm's served context — word-boundary string containment on the served
text, or a structural read of the served payload (the entry / fact dicts
the serving call returned). No answerer and no judge, so SCORING never
needs a GPU.

The two sources differ in what building the bank costs, and the docs must
not blur them. The synthetic source is CPU-only end to end and its score
fields are byte-reproducible on a rerun (the ``meta`` timestamps and wall
times of course differ). The LongMemEval source builds each bank through
the real extractor: the 2026-09-05 run spent 826.4 s of GPU extraction,
and it is reproducible only to the extent the extractor is. ``--extractor
floor`` is the no-LLM rung for checking that path on CPU, and
``--rescore-from`` re-scores an already-extracted run's persisted rows
with no bank and no GPU at all.

Five dimensions (see the spec for the full definitions and the
preregistered expectations):

  D1 ``update_following``   the slot's current value is served
  D2 ``stale_serving``      a superseded value is served and the current
                            value is not (a DEFECT count: lower is better)
  D3 ``staleness_marking``  a slot past 2xTTL is served carrying the stale
                            signal
  D4 ``abstention_support`` a never-stated slot surfaces no value —
                            reported beside ``answer_coverage``, which the
                            no-memory arm trivially fails
  D5 ``retraction_handling``a corrected value is served together with its
                            correction signal (the supersession chain, or a
                            served turn's ``superseded_by_text``)

Arms are IMPORTED, never re-implemented: ``longmemeval_bench.build_contexts``
and ``serve_comparator_arms`` build every served context, so an arm here and
an arm of the same name in the LongMemEval harness are the same object. The
``cascade`` arm is a CONTEXT-level proxy (cortex when non-empty, else rag)
and is not comparable to the judged answer-level cascade — every artifact
says so in ``caveats``.

Ground truth comes from two sources:

  synthetic  a seeded generator; facts are written straight through
             ``cortex_write`` with the session's timestamp, so no extractor
             runs. Extraction is held at PERFECT, which makes the synthetic
             cortex arm a ceiling on the deployed system, not a measurement
             of it. Stamped in every artifact's ``caveats``.
  lme        the LongMemEval knowledge-update slice, derived by pure
             parsing (23 of 78 questions qualify). Its bank is built
             per question by the real ``ingest_and_dream`` path, so the
             cortex/hybrid arms measure the DEPLOYED pipeline — retrieval
             and extraction together — and need an extractor endpoint
             (``--extractor``, default ``qwen-27b``; ``--extractor floor``
             is the no-LLM regex rung for CPU plumbing checks). The slice
             grades D1, D2 and D5; D3 and D4 report ``n: 0`` because the
             dataset carries no freshness class and no never-stated
             question. The run is resumable per question: rows are
             appended as each finishes and a restart skips them, because
             this source shares the GPU.
