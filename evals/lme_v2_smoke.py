"""LongMemEval-V2 GPU smoke — `procedure` category, per-trajectory dreams.

Runs the pilot decisions pre-registered in ``lme_v2_adapter.py``'s READY-TO-RUN
block and ``data/lme_v2/FORMAT-NOTES.md`` end to end, mirroring
``longmemeval_bench.py``'s ingest -> dream -> answer -> judge shape but over
LME-V2 *trajectories* instead of chat sessions:

  Category   : ``procedure`` (workflow-knowledge, 74 questions, ALL text-only).
               NOT ``errors-gotchas`` — those are multimodal (FORMAT-NOTES.md).
  Observations: ON, DISTILLED (Fix A). The adapter no longer dumps raw trees
               (that starved the corpus of gold labels AND was 47x the baseline);
               with ``include_observations=True`` each state contributes a
               resolved action label (``clicked: link "Reports"`` — the opaque
               bid mapped to its node) plus a capped page context (title +
               headers). Gold module names go from 0 occurrences to present.
  Extraction : trajectory-mode prompt (Fix B) — extracts the ORDERED WORKFLOW and
               environment affordances, not durable user facts. The shipped
               ``_SYSTEM_PROMPT`` and all product paths stay byte-identical.
  Synthesis  : a cross-trajectory pass (Fix C) clusters same-task procedure
               claims into a canonical 'typical workflow' fact, weighting
               ``outcome=success`` trajectories over ``failure`` on conflict.
  Store policy: every adapted turn stored (store-everything v1; voluntary-capture
               simulation is a future arm).
  Dream cadence: one dream per TRAJECTORY (the natural unit — one goal — and it
               mirrors ingest_and_dream's per-session boundary).
  Scope      : ``--limit N`` questions (default 1), each ingesting only the
               trajectories its haystack references, capped at
               ``--max-trajectories`` (default 20 of 100 — a SMOKE, not the
               bench; the cap is logged loudly per the no-silent-caps rule).
  Arms       : rag / cortex / hybrid, contexts built *exactly* as
               ``longmemeval_bench.build_contexts`` builds them, with the same
               answerer/judge prompts. Per-arm wall-clock query latency is
               recorded (LME-V2 scores latency as well as accuracy).
  Scoring    : LME-V2's own deterministic ``eval_function`` per question is the
               primary metric (``{arm}_correct``); the LLM judge is kept as a
               secondary signal (``{arm}_judge``). Only the three spec heads that
               appear in ``procedure`` are implemented — an unimplemented head in
               the selected slice fails loudly at load, never silently skipped.

Isolation: the dedicated ``pseudolife_memory_bench`` DB (``build_service`` ->
``reset_bench``), a fresh temp data-dir per question — the live bank is never
touched. Results append to a resumable JSONL (kill + rerun to continue) with a
summary written by ``--report``.

Data: the adapter's ``data/lme_v2/`` files. This module may run from a git
worktree that shares no data with the main checkout, so the data dir is resolved
via ``LME_V2_DATA_DIR`` (env) -> local ``evals/data/lme_v2`` -> the main
checkout derived from ``git --git-common-dir`` (see ``resolve_data_dir``).

# Fix B — trajectory-mode extraction prompt (EVALS-ONLY).
#
# The shipped ``_SYSTEM_PROMPT`` asks for durable, current-state USER facts and
# skips narrative/transient state — exactly what a web-agent trajectory is, so
# it yields ~nothing (5 claims / 458 turns in the overnight smoke). This variant
# targets trajectory content: it extracts the ORDERED WORKFLOW (the class that
# answers `procedure` questions) and environment affordances, and drops the
# click-by-click narrative. It is passed to ``OpenAICompatExtractor`` via its
# optional ``system_prompt`` arg; the shipped daemon prompt and every product
# code path are untouched (the regression gate pins those).

    "module/page names separated by '; ', read from the resolved click labels "
    "and page titles (NEVER the raw bids). Emit ONE ordered claim for the task, "

_V2_ANSWER_SYSTEM = """\
You answer questions about how to perform tasks in a software environment,
using ONLY the memory context provided.

The context holds procedural memory from past task executions: 'typical
workflow (modules used (in order))' facts, 'documented procedure (modules in
order)' facts distilled from company protocol documents, module-purpose
facts, and raw navigation snippets. When the question says to follow a NAMED
company protocol, that protocol's 'documented procedure' fact is
authoritative — prefer it over any 'typical workflow' click-path recorded
for the same task. The question may also describe a task that NO stored
workflow matches verbatim. In that case, COMPOSE the procedure from
components: first work out what information the task needs and which module
provides it (see the module-purpose facts), then which module carries out
the action. A workflow for a related task can lend its structure.

Answer format: reason briefly if you must, then END with the final answer in
the exact form the question requests (inside \\boxed{} when asked). The final
answer is ONLY the module names, in order of use, separated by '; '. Use each
module's short canonical navigator name (e.g. 'Reports', 'Problems',
'Incidents') — not page or record variants ('Problems list', 'Problem
record' -> 'Problems'). Never repeat a module name; if the question asks for
N modules, give exactly N. Keep reasoning to at most three short sentences —
then STOP and give the final answer. If the context contains nothing
relevant to the task, answer exactly: I don't know.

Example. Question: what two modules do we use, in order, to fulfil a catalog
order? Answer in \\boxed{}. Context: 'Order Fulfilment — documented procedure
(modules in order): Catalog; Requests; Requests'. Correct output:
The documented procedure is Catalog then Requests (duplicate dropped).
