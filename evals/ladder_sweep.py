"""Extractor-ladder benchmark sweep (dev-only).

Finds the *minimum viable extraction model* — the lowest rung that beats
naive-RAG on knowledge-update + efficiency — by running the same corpus through
each rung's extractor and measuring:

  * gold_recoverable  — fraction of update-pairs whose CURRENT value is the one
                        the system returns (cortex for the SUT; top-k retrieval
                        for naive-RAG).
  * stale_leak        — fraction whose OLD (superseded) value is still returned.
  * tokens_per_query  — approx tokens the agent must read to answer (the cortex
                        fact block for the SUT; the top-k raw turns for naive).
  * search_latency_ms — mean answer latency.
  * extract_seconds   — wall-time to consolidate the whole corpus (off hot-path;
                        CPU rungs are slower — reported, not penalised).

Each rung writes ``evals/results/<rung>.json`` so the (slow, one-at-a-time CPU
and LAN) rungs can run incrementally overnight; ``--report`` aggregates them
into the per-rung table + minimum-viable verdict. ``--abstain <rung>`` runs the
abstention threshold sub-sweep.

Isolation + safety:
  * Runs against a DEDICATED ``pseudolife_memory_bench`` database (created if
    missing, truncated before each ingest). The live bank (``pseudolife_memory``)
    is NEVER touched.
  * Forces CPU (``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1``) so the 4090 is left alone.
  * Skips unreachable rungs (LAN endpoints down) and records status="unreachable".

See evals/README.md for endpoints, prerequisites, and how to read the verdict.
